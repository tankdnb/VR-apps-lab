# VR-apps-lab

English | [Русский](README.ru.md)

`VR-apps-lab` is a public `knowledge repository`, `pattern library`, and `working
base` for building VR utilities, overlays, diagnostics tools, tracking helpers,
and experimental XR integrations.

This repo is no longer best described as one standalone VR app.

It started from a `Reality Window` prototype, but it has grown into something
more useful: a curated place where we collect studied repositories, reusable
methods, implementation patterns, prototype code, and research workflows for
future VR tools.

## What this repository is

`VR-apps-lab` combines three layers:

1. `Knowledge repository`
   - studied public VR-related repositories
   - extracted implementation methods
   - overlap families and research waves
   - backlog-driven discovery and deep-pass workflow
2. `Working foundation`
   - reusable `OpenVR` prototype code in `C# / .NET 8`
   - shared runtime and processing abstractions
   - spike apps and helper scripts
3. `Experiment archive`
   - passthrough and camera experiments
   - feasibility notes
   - dead ends that still produced useful engineering knowledge

## Who this repository is for

- VR developers looking for implementation references
- people building utilities, overlays, dashboards, and VR power-user tools
- researchers comparing public VR projects and extracting methods
- contributors who want to add new repositories in a structured way
- Russian-speaking users who need an additional entry point in Russian

## What this repository contains

- a canonical registry of tracked VR repositories
- reusable methods and product patterns for VR utility development
- landscape docs grouped by families and research waves
- a working `OpenVR` companion overlay prototype
- `PICO/OpenXR` spike apps and feasibility research
- helper scripts for repeatable GitHub research passes

## Current identity of the project

The most accurate way to describe `VR-apps-lab` today is:

- `knowledge repository for VR utility development`
- `curated research base for VR tools and overlays`
- `pattern library plus working prototypes`

What it should not promise:

- one finished end-user product
- universal passthrough support
- production-ready support for every runtime and headset

## Repository entry points

Start here:

- `README.ru.md` for the Russian-language overview
- `docs/README.md` for the English documentation index
- `docs/README.ru.md` for the Russian documentation index
- `docs/foundation/repository-positioning.md` for the public-facing repository
  identity
- `docs/research/methods/vr-utility-methods-catalog.md` for reusable methods
- `docs/research/catalog/project-registry.md` for the canonical tracked-project
  list

## Working code and prototypes

The repository still includes real code and experiments.

The main code foundation currently includes:

- `OpenVR` overlay prototype code
- reusable camera/source abstractions
- frame-processing pipeline building blocks
- `PICO/OpenXR` probing experiments

## Desktop app commands

From the repository root:

```powershell
dotnet build .\VRRealityWindowMvp.sln
dotnet run --project .\src\VRRealityWindow.App -- doctor
dotnet run --project .\src\VRRealityWindow.App -- probe --source test-pattern
dotnet run --project .\src\VRRealityWindow.App -- overlay --source test-pattern
```

Useful variants:

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\src\VRRealityWindow.App -- doctor --target-headset pico-4-pro
dotnet run --project .\src\VRRealityWindow.App -- probe --source tracked-camera
dotnet run --project .\src\VRRealityWindow.App -- overlay --anchor left-hand
dotnet run --project .\src\VRRealityWindow.App -- overlay --duration-seconds 20
```

## Reusable building blocks

- `ICameraProvider` abstraction for interchangeable video sources
- `FrameProcessingPipeline` for CPU-side processing and future GPU upgrades
- `OpenVrOverlayPresenter` for world-space utility windows
- JSON settings and experiment configuration
- `PicoOpenXrExtensionProbe` for Android/OpenXR capability discovery

## Best next outputs from this repository

- new VR utilities built on top of the existing foundation
- structured deep-pass research waves
- reusable methods for overlay, OpenXR layer, tracker bridge, and diagnostics
- contribution-ready public knowledge for other VR developers

## How changes are validated here

`VR-apps-lab` is not maintained like a single shipping app.

For `research` and `documentation` changes, the main quality checks are:

- repository structure stays coherent;
- links and navigation remain valid;
- registry, families, methods, and backlog stay aligned;
- the repository description stays honest about support boundaries.

For `prototype` or runnable `tool` changes, validation may also include build
checks, smoke tests, and runtime notes for the affected component.
