# Project Families

- Date: `2026-04-11`
- Goal: reorganize the `VR.app` research corpus around logical overlap
  families instead of a long flat list of repositories.

## Why this file exists

At this point `VR.app` already contains:

- a large initial landscape pass;
- multiple follow-up research waves;
- several focused reuse-plan documents;
- deeper passes on under-documented repositories.

The next useful step is not more random expansion. It is `grouping`,
`deduplication by idea`, and understanding which clusters are already mature.

## Status legend

- `Already studied`
  covered well enough across one or more existing docs.
- `Partially studied`
  present in `VR.app`, but still deserving a dedicated deeper code-level pass.
- `Not studied deeply`
  either missing from the repo or only known through a quick mention.
- `Fork / variant only`
  valuable for comparison, but probably not worth a full standalone deep dive
  before the main upstream is understood.

## Family 1: OpenXR runtime switchers and layer managers

This family is already converging into the future `OpenXR Doctor` direction.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `fredemmott/OpenXR-API-Layers-GUI` | Already studied | Strongest layer diagnostics and enable/disable UX reference |
| `WaGi-Coding/OpenXR-Runtime-Switcher` | Already studied | Runtime switching reference with admin-aware UX |
| `UniStuttgart-VISUS/OpenXR-Runtime-Switcher` | Already studied | Alternate runtime switcher framing |
| `ytdlder/OpenXR-Switcher` | Already studied | Runtime and layer toggling overlap |
| `jonyrh/OXR_Switcher` | Already studied | Runtime manager UX variant with CLI angle |
| `mbucchia/OpenXR-Layer-Template` | Already studied | Bootstrap template for future layer work |
| `Jabbah/OpenXR-Layer-OBSMirror` | Already studied | Practical example of a layer built from a template |
| `maluoi/openxr-explorer` | Already studied | Strongest single reference for `OpenXR doctor/runtime inspector` |

### Consolidation note

This is one of the highest-overlap families in the whole repository. The main
output of this family for `VR.app` should be a single future product concept:

- `OpenXR Doctor`

## Family 2: SteamVR/OpenVR notification and remote-control overlays

This family centers on letting an external process drive overlay or
notification behavior.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `BOLL7708/OpenVROverlayPipe` | Already studied | Best reference for `server-driven overlay creation` |
| `jeppevinkel/OpenVRNotificationPipe` | Already studied | Focused notification pipe reference |
| `WiiPlayer2/VnotifieR` | Partially studied | Same product family, useful as a comparison point |
| `BOLL7708/OpenVR2WS` | Already studied | Broader runtime I/O and settings bridge |

### Consolidation note

This family points toward a future `VR notification / overlay service bus`
instead of several unrelated mini-tools.

## Family 3: Lighthouse managers and room-state helpers

This is a large family with very high overlap in problem space and very low
need for flat duplication in the index.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `kurotu/OVR-Lighthouse-Manager` | Already studied | One of the main Windows references |
| `DHCPCD9/go-steamvr-lighthouse-manager` | Already studied | Alternate UI/automation angle |
| `xi-ve/openvr-lighthouse-manager-linux` | Already studied | Linux port/reference |
| `nouser2013/lighthouse-v2-manager` | Already studied | Small scripting-oriented variant |
| `SeeUnsharp/LighthouseManager` | Already studied | Command-line and Windows BLE angle |
| `seader/LighthouseManagerPimax` | Already studied | Pimax-oriented variant |
| `FennecLabsLtd/LighthouseManager` | Already studied | Config backup/restore framing |
| `risa2000/lhctrl` | Already studied | Linux BLE micro-tool for v1 |
| `risa2000/lh2ctrl` | Already studied | Linux BLE micro-tool for v2 |

### Consolidation note

This family deserves a later comparative matrix, because the main axis is not
just platform but also:

- `power only`
- `BLE control`
- `room/config backup`
- `SteamVR automation`

## Family 4: Battery and device-monitor utilities

This family has a lot of logical duplication, but it is still useful because it
shows different product scales: tray app, overlay, notification tool, inventory
panel, and logging utility.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `OVRTools/OpenVRDeviceBattery` | Already studied | Strong tray-app and background-helper reference |
| `zeroae/VRBattery` | Partially studied | Good battery-only overlay/product reference |
| `Black4Blade/SteamVR-Devices-Battery-Status` | Already studied | Tiny battery micro-tool reference |
| `rhaamo/OpenVR-Display-Devices` | Already studied | Broader device inventory view |
| `jangxx/openvr-battery-monitoring` | Not studied deeply | Likely useful for notifications/logging behavior |
| `mutr/openvr_battery_monitor` | Not studied deeply | Another narrow monitoring variant worth comparing |

### Consolidation note

This should become a single `Device Monitor` family inside `VR.app`, with
sub-modes like:

- wrist/device overlay
- tray/desktop watcher
- notification-only helper
- inventory/detail screen

## Family 5: Virtual tracker, OSC, WebSocket, and bridge tooling

This is one of the most strategically valuable families because it converts
external data into `SteamVR/OpenVR devices`, `pose streams`, or `OSC events`.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Timocop/PSMoveServiceEx-VMT` | Already studied | Core virtual-tracker reference |
| `gpsnmeajp/VirtualMotionTracker` | Partially studied | Likely central project in this family |
| `John-Dean/OpenVR-Tracker-Websocket-Driver` | Partially studied | Strong WebSocket-native tracker-driver reference |
| `surplex-io/OpenVR-Driver` | Partially studied | Alternative evolution of the same idea |
| `3NekoSystem/OpenVR-Tracker-Websocket-Driver` | Not studied deeply | Variant/fork comparison target |
| `v0xie/OpenVR-Tracker-Websocket-Driver` | Not studied deeply | Variant/fork comparison target |
| `krazysh01/VirtualDesktop-OpenVR-Trackers` | Partially studied | Body-state bridge from an external ecosystem |
| `Greendayle/SteamVR_To_OSC` | Already studied | SteamVR to OSC bridge |
| `ZekkVRC/OpenVR2OSC` | Already studied | VRChat-oriented input bridge |
| `BarakChamo/OpenVR-OSC` | Not studied deeply | Should be added for broader OSC comparison |
| `jangxx/steamvr-osc-control` | Already studied | Control bridge for SteamVR functions |

### Consolidation note

This family is the clearest foundation for a future:

- `Tracker Bridge Service`
- `SteamVR/OSC bridge`
- `external sensor -> virtual tracker` platform

## Family 6: Desktop and overlay utility suites

This family overlaps heavily in product goal even when implementation differs
by runtime or operating system.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DesktopXR` | Already studied | OpenXR desktop-overlay product reference |
| `DesktopPlus` | Already studied | Strongest Windows/OpenVR product reference |
| `OpenVRDesktopDisplayPortal` | Already studied | Early but feature-rich overlay utility |
| `DesktopPortal` | Already studied | Utility-suite framing with watch controls |
| `UVROverlay` | Already studied | General-purpose overlay shell |
| `WlxOverlay` | Already studied | Linux-first overlay reference |
| `wlx-overlay-s` | Already studied | Modern lightweight Linux overlay reference |
| `wlx-overlay-x` | Already studied | Transitional OpenXR overlay path |
| `fnuidesktop-VR` | Already studied | Direct desktop interaction patterns |
| `wayvr` | Already studied | Low-overhead desktop/app-launching view |
| `CrispyPin/ovr-utils` | Partially studied | GitHub snapshot is stale and moved off-platform |
| `mittorn/ovr-utils-dashboard` | Partially studied | Useful dashboard-style variant |

### Consolidation note

This family should feed a future comparative UX document, not just more
individual project entries. The real overlap axes are:

- `desktop mirror`
- `window portal`
- `wrist/watch controls`
- `dashboard suite`
- `Linux vs Windows UX`
- `OpenVR overlay vs OpenXR layer`

## Family 7: Accessibility overlays and assistive HUDs

This family is present in the repo, but not yet treated as a first-class
product direction.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Vinventive/live-captions-vr` | Already studied | Speech-to-text overlay reference |
| `MochiDoesVR/OpenVRCaptions` | Already studied | C#/SteamVR captions reference |
| `OpenVROverlayPipe` / notification tools | Already studied | Assistive notification angle |
| `TurnSignal` | Already studied | Comfort/safety micro-utility |
| `SteamVR_ClockOverlay_Public` | Already studied | Minimal assistive wrist-clock pattern |

### Consolidation note

This is big enough to be treated as a product family:

- captions
- status hints
- assistive HUDs
- comfort and orientation helpers

## Family 8: Driver tutorials and custom-device plumbing

This family is less about end-user utilities and more about building the
knowledge needed for `device-side tooling`.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `terminal29/Simple-OpenVR-Driver-Tutorial` | Partially studied | Important learning-path repo |
| `ValveSoftware/openvr` tutorial/sample code | Already studied | Foundational reference |
| `LucidVR/opengloves-driver` | Partially studied | Hand-specific custom device path |
| `r57zone/OpenVR-ArduinoHMD` | Partially studied | DIY HMD and config-driven setup |
| `DaniXmir/GlassVr` | Partially studied | XR/AR glasses bridge and emulation |
| `Copprhead/hotas-vr-controller` | Partially studied | Domain-specific cockpit/device bridge |
| `TrueOpenVR/SteamVR-TrueOpenVR` | Not studied deeply | Candidate for a later driver pass |
| `HoboVR-Labs/hobo_vr` | Partially studied | Driver prototyping and external poser model |

### Consolidation note

This should eventually become a dedicated learning track in `VR.app`:

- `driver tutorial`
- `custom device plumbing`
- `domain-specific hardware bridges`

## Family 9: Vendor enhancement and mod layers

These projects are especially useful because they sit `on top of` official
vendor stacks instead of replacing them.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `BnuuySolutions/PSVR2Toolkit` | Partially studied | Strongest current vendor-enhancement reference |
| `PSVR2-related forks/variants` | Not studied deeply | Worth mapping later if this branch expands |

### Consolidation note

This family supports a future `vendor enhancement` research direction:

- augment official stack
- keep vendor runtime intact
- expose extra features through utility-side APIs

## Recommended synthesis path for `VR.app`

The next useful step is not another long unsorted list.

It is:

1. build product concepts around `families`, not repos;
2. prioritize deep dives where status is `Partially studied` or
   `Not studied deeply`;
3. keep forks/variants as comparison nodes instead of promoting each one to a
   full standalone research wave.
