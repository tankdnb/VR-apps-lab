# Project Families

- Date: `2026-04-19`
- Goal: reorganize the `VR-apps-lab` research corpus around logical overlap
  families instead of a long flat list of repositories.

## Why this file exists

At this point `VR-apps-lab` already contains:

- a large initial landscape pass;
- multiple follow-up research waves;
- several focused reuse-plan documents;
- deeper passes on under-documented repositories.

The next useful step is not more random expansion. It is `grouping`,
`deduplication by idea`, and understanding which clusters are already mature.

## Status legend

- `Already studied`
  covered well enough across one or more existing docs.
- `Partially studied`
  present in `VR-apps-lab`, but still deserving a dedicated deeper code-level pass.
- `Not studied deeply`
  either missing from the repo or only known through a quick mention.
- `Fork / variant only`
  valuable for comparison, but probably not worth a full standalone deep dive
  before the main upstream is understood.

## Family 1: OpenXR runtime switchers, inventories, and layer managers

This family is already converging into the future `OpenXR Doctor` direction.

### Consolidation note

This is one of the highest-overlap families in the whole repository. The main
output of this family for `VR-apps-lab` should be a single future product concept:

- `OpenXR Doctor`
- `runtime capability matrix`
- `runtime adapter and bring-up playbook`

## Family 2: SteamVR/OpenVR notification and remote-control overlays

This family centers on letting an external process drive overlay or
notification behavior.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `BOLL7708/OpenVROverlayPipe` | Already studied | Best reference for `server-driven overlay creation` |
| `jeppevinkel/OpenVRNotificationPipe` | Already studied | Focused notification pipe reference |

### Consolidation note

This family points toward a future `VR notification / overlay service bus`
instead of several unrelated mini-tools.

## Family 3: Lighthouse managers and room-state helpers

This is a large family with very high overlap in problem space and very low
need for flat duplication in the index.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `kurotu/OVR-Lighthouse-Manager` | Already studied | One of the main Windows references |
| `DHCPCD9/go-steamvr-lighthouse-manager` | Already studied | Alternate UI/automation angle |

| `ugokutennp/watchman-pairing-assistant` | Already studied | GUI wrapper around pairing flows and `lighthouse_console` |

### Consolidation note

This family deserves a later comparative matrix, because the main axis is not
just platform but also:

- `power only`
- `BLE control`
- `room/config backup`
- `SteamVR automation`

## Family 4: Battery and device-monitor utilities

This family has a lot of logical duplication, but it is still useful because it
shows different product scales: tray app, overlay, notification tool, inventory
panel, and logging utility.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `OVRTools/OpenVRDeviceBattery` | Already studied | Strong tray-app and background-helper reference |
| `zeroae/VRBattery` | Already studied | Tiny Qt battery widget rendered into an OpenVR dashboard surface |

| `rhaamo/OpenVR-Display-Devices` | Already studied | Broader device inventory view |
| `copperpixel/steamvrbattery` | Already studied | Minimal CLI property-polling battery monitor |
| `Denwa/vive-wireless-info-overlay` | Not studied deeply | Source-light wireless-temperature micro-overlay whose product framing is stronger than its visible code donor value |

| `mutr/openvr_battery_monitor` | Already studied | Background battery exporter that writes per-device telemetry to InfluxDB |

### Consolidation note

This should become a single `Device Monitor` family inside `VR-apps-lab`, with
sub-modes like:

- wrist/device overlay
- tray/desktop watcher
- notification-only helper
- inventory/detail screen

## Family 5: Virtual tracker, OSC, WebSocket, and bridge tooling

This is one of the most strategically valuable families because it converts
external data into `SteamVR/OpenVR devices`, `pose streams`, or `OSC events`.

| `ThatGuyThimo/leapmotion-osc` | Not studied deeply | Finger-only OSC egress utility adjacent to the hand-tracking and avatar-parameter bridge family |

### Consolidation note

This family is the clearest foundation for a future:

- `Tracker Bridge Service`
- `SteamVR/OSC bridge`
- `external sensor -> virtual tracker` platform
- `engine-side role reuse and direct consumer export`

## Family 6: Desktop and overlay utility suites

| `SteveMarkhamGIT/SmudgeTimerOpenVR` | Already studied | Wrist-mounted game-status overlay with controller-tip gesture triggering and generated-texture updates |

### Consolidation note

This family should feed a future comparative UX document, not just more
individual project entries. The real overlap axes are:

- `desktop mirror`
- `window portal`
- `wrist/watch controls`
- `dashboard suite`
- `overlay patch micro-tool`
- `media/player overlay`
- `annotation surface`
- `game-specific status surface`
- `Linux vs Windows UX`
- `OpenVR overlay vs OpenXR layer`

## Family 7: Accessibility overlays and assistive HUDs

This family is now clearly large enough to be treated as a first-class product
direction.

### Consolidation note

This is big enough to be treated as a product family:

- captions
- status hints
- assistive HUDs
- comfort and orientation helpers
- anchored room-awareness overlays

## Family 8: Driver tutorials and custom-device plumbing

This family is less about end-user utilities and more about building the
knowledge needed for `device-side tooling`.

- `synthetic controller and input-emulation sidecars`
- `pose rewriting and motion-manipulation drivers`
- `domain-specific hardware bridges`
- `virtual display and repurposed output drivers`

## Family 9: Vendor enhancement and mod layers

These projects are especially useful because they sit `on top of` official
vendor stacks instead of replacing them.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `BnuuySolutions/PSVR2Toolkit` | Already studied | Vendor-driver wrapper with versioned IPC for gaze data and trigger-effect control |

| `PSVR2-related forks/variants` | Not studied deeply | Worth mapping later if this branch expands |

### Consolidation note

This family supports a future `vendor enhancement` research direction:

- augment official stack
- keep vendor runtime intact
- expose extra features through utility-side APIs

## Family 10: Compatibility layers and runtime translation

These projects sit between incompatible or competing runtime ecosystems and are
valuable for understanding translation, emulation, and compatibility shims.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `QuestCraftPlusPlus/OpenComposite` | Already studied | Main OpenVR-to-OpenXR compatibility reference |
| `Supreeeme/xrizer` | Already studied | Alternate OpenVR-on-OpenXR direction |

| `terminal29/OSVR-SteamVR-Bridge` | Already studied | Smaller alias-mapping comparison node for the same OSVR-to-SteamVR bridge family |

### Consolidation note

This family matters less as a direct product target and more as a source of:

- translation-layer architecture
- runtime compatibility patterns
- install and registration models

## Family 11: Performance, rendering, and post-process tooling

This family is about image processing, foveation, scaling, and rendering-side
instrumentation rather than overlays or device control.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `fholger/vrperfkit` | Already studied | Main donor for D3D11 post-process patterns |
| `fholger/openvr_fsr` | Already studied | Earlier, smaller reference for the same lineage |

| `zhukovv/upscale-injection` | Already studied | Generic D3D11 injection and upscaling donor for low-level hook mechanics |

### Consolidation note

This family should feed:

- GPU-side processing ideas
- future texture-path upgrades
- foveation and eye-tracking experimentation

## Family 12: Passthrough, reality layers, and camera experiments

This family matters because it covers real-world view, passthrough, and
camera-adjacent utility directions, even though not all projects are practical
product donors for current target hardware.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Rectus/openxr-steamvr-passthrough` | Already studied | Closest PC/SteamVR architectural analogue to the original idea |
| `zhangxuelei86/WMR-Passthrough` | Already studied | OpenXR API-layer plus camera-service pattern |

| `jangxx/LeapOVRPassthrough` | Already studied | Gesture-triggered passthrough UX reference |
| `alexander-clarke/openvr-room-mapping` | Already studied | Pose-plus-image capture pipeline that sits between environment reconstruction and alignment research |

### Consolidation note

This family is now best treated as:

- `research and experimentation`
- `external camera / scoped passthrough` inspiration

rather than a guaranteed production direction.

## Family 13: Creator tools, capture, metrics, and workflow utilities

These projects are more about recording, inspection, workflow support, and
creator-facing XR use than about simple end-user overlays.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|

| `kuentzel/ROVER` | Already studied | Standalone questionnaire and study station whose overlay manager, operator UI, and importable study schema matter more than any one screen |

### Consolidation note

This family supports a separate `creator and diagnostics` branch inside
`VR-apps-lab`, not just consumer-facing overlays.

It also strengthens a smaller but useful sub-branch:

- screenshot workflow helpers
- creator micro-automation tools
- remote-triggered capture flows
- creator control surfaces
- standalone study stations

## Family 14: Overlay implementation references and host scaffolds

| `ondorela/OpenVROverlay_imgui` | Already studied | Small D3D11 plus ImGui sample showing direct overlay-event forwarding into the UI stack |
| `thomasmo/SampleVRO` | Already studied | Explicit Win32 plus D3D11 texture-to-overlay sample with forwarded keyboard or pointer interaction |
| `ovrlay/LibOverlay` | Already studied | Minimal Unity helper over raw OpenVR overlay calls with tracked-device attachment and texture refresh |
| `Marlamin/VROverlayTest` | Not studied deeply | Additional D3D11 overlay scratchpad that may matter only if a future pass needs an even thinner Windows baseline |
| `ephemeral-laboratories/ComposeVR` | Not studied deeply | Prototype of rendering Jetpack Compose into an OpenVR overlay, useful mainly if a future pass needs `Compose-style UI -> overlay texture` |

### Consolidation note

This family should feed `VR-apps-lab` as a methods donor layer:

- overlay lifecycle references
- graphics-path references
- UI stack references
- host-scene and render-loop scaffolds
- overlay patch helpers
- engine-side overlay extension hooks
- engine-native projection-overlay extensions
- UI-to-texture bridges with explicit event forwarding

## Family 15: SteamVR environment helpers and runtime hygiene tools

These utilities improve the way SteamVR behaves around startup, dashboard
interaction, distortion, or overlay-heavy workflows.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `MuffinTastic/steamvr-exconfig` | Already studied | Backup-safe config patcher for disabling autolaunch apps and always-active drivers before startup |
| `BnuuySolutions/OculusKiller` | Already studied | Vendor-shell replacement that redirects Oculus launch flow into SteamVR |
| `username223/SteamVRNoHeadset` | Already studied | Null-driver and no-HMD recipe for SteamVR workflows |
| `n1ckfg/ViveTrackerExample` | Already studied | Tracker-without-HMD workflow and tiny Unity helper |

| `sencercoltu/steamvr-undistort` | Already studied | Lens distortion adjustment tool for custom optics |
| `elvissteinjr/SteamVR-VoidScene` | Already studied | Minimal scene app to lower baseline cost for overlay use |
| `shieldmeidunn/SteamVRNullFlipper` | Already studied | Tiny backup-aware helper for flipping SteamVR into null-driver mode |
| `Virus-vr/SteamVRAdaptiveBrightness` | Already studied | Mirror-texture feedback daemon that continuously rewrites SteamVR brightness |
| `username223/SteamVR-ActionsManifestValidator` | Already studied | CI-friendly manifest linter with explicit warning gates and duplicate-key rejection |
| `Erimelowo/Lighthouse-Scale-Fix` | Already studied | Backup-safe one-shot patcher for lighthouse scale configuration |
| `DavidRisch/steamvr_utils` | Already studied | Linux helper collection with a SteamVR lifecycle daemon, base-station power control, and audio switching |

### Consolidation note

This family points toward a separate `environment helper` track inside
`VR-apps-lab`, not just overlays:

- tray toggles
- dashboard fixes
- scene-host helpers
- compositor and distortion helpers
- headsetless/null-driver helpers
- vendor-shell redirects and focused config patchers
- validation and lint micro-tools
- backup-safe config patchers

## Family 17: Calibration, motion compensation, and tracking alignment

These projects are unified by one practical problem: helping the user keep
different tracking spaces, poses, or sensors aligned enough to remain usable.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pushrax/OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator` | Already studied | Foundational mixed-space calibration reference |
| `Stavdel/OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator` | Already studied | Fork line preserved mainly for historical comparison |
| `Marshall-vak/OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator2` | Already studied | Continuous-calibration extension of the SpaceCalibrator idea |
| `BuzzteeBear/OpenXR-MotionCompensation` | Already studied | OpenXR-side motion compensation and calibration flow |
| `openvrmc/OpenVR-MotionCompensation` | Already studied | Driver-side pose rewrite plus dashboard configuration path |
| `RedHawk989/EyeTrackVR-OpenVR-Calibration-Overlay` | Already studied | Minimal overlay-first 9-point eye-tracking calibration surface |
| `alexander-clarke/openvr-room-mapping` | Already studied | Spatial capture and reconstruction path that overlaps with alignment and room-space research |
| `tobexeon/PSVR2EyeTrackingCalibration` | Not studied deeply | Real-time PSVR2 eye-calibration client that currently depends on a custom toolkit fork |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because the best tracking helper is often not a new sensor
or a new driver, but a better `alignment UX`:

- guided point sequences
- overlay-first feedback
- persistent offsets
- continuous correction
- pose-rewrite layers and drivers
- capture-driven alignment artifacts

## Family 16: Vision-based tracking, hand-input bridges, and headsetless camera runtimes

This family covers repositories that use cameras, computer vision,
hand-tracking services, or foreign runtimes to generate SteamVR devices or
OpenXR substitute inputs without relying on classic lighthouse-tracked
controller stacks.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ultraleap/driver_ultraleap` | Already studied | Mature hardware-service to SteamVR hand-driver path with optional elbow trackers and a `DebugRequest` external-input hook |
| `Nordskog/HandOfLesser` | Already studied | Quest/OpenXR hand-tracking bridge into SteamVR and VRChat with structured packets plus named-pipe and UDP transport |
| `NovaAshwolfDev/HandCameraDriver` | Already studied | Archived webcam-hand-tracking WIP with a Python-sidecar plus custom SteamVR driver split |
| `KinectToVR/KinectToVR` | Already studied | Legacy multi-process Kinect and PSMove full-body stack with heavy calibration and tracker-orientation math |
| `KinectToVR/Amethyst` | Already studied | Plugin-based body-tracking host with device plugins and service-endpoint contracts |
| `ju1ce/Mediapipe-VR-Fullbody-Tracking` | Already studied | Single-camera body tracking with switchable SteamVR-driver and VRChat OSC backends plus Quest-friendly WebUI |
| `Wunder-Wulfe/NVIDIA-BodyTracking` | Already studied | GPU-assisted camera body-tracking driver with overlay-assisted alignment and dense tracker-role configuration |
| `chnoblouch/aethervr` | Already studied | Webcam-driven custom OpenXR runtime with a Python tracker connected over local TCP |
| `MasonSakai/VR-AI-Full-Body-Tracking` | Not studied deeply | Camera FBT comparison node still partly anchored in an InputEmulator-era transition |

### Consolidation note

This family shows that `vision-driven XR utility design` is now large enough to
split into several repeatable sub-branches:

- `service-backed hand drivers`
- `camera CV sidecars with SteamVR or OSC backends`
- `legacy tracker apps evolving into plugin platforms`
- `headsetless camera runtimes`

The strongest future product concepts suggested by this family are:

- `vision tracking sandbox`
- `driver/backend-agnostic tracking bridge`
- `headsetless camera QA runtime`

## Family 18: Text entry, tracked keyboards, and non-native input surfaces

This family covers the UI surfaces that let a VR utility collect text or short
commands without bouncing the user back to a desktop monitor.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `campfireunion/VRKeys` | Already studied | Focused drum-style keyboard with validation-aware lifecycle, layout switching, and hand-attached mallets |
| `ultraleap/XR-Keyboard` | Already studied | Physical keyboard generator with prefab, manager, and keymap split |
| `oculus-samples/Unity-TrackedKeyboard` | Already studied | Tracked hardware keyboard sample with hand-proximity reveal and MR desk context |
| `Ayfel/MRTK-Keyboard` | Already studied | Semantic non-native keyboard with multiple layout modes and host-facing callbacks |
| `RTUITLab/Oculus-HandTracking-Keyboard` | Already studied | Lightweight fingertip-driven hand-tracking keyboard experiment |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `text entry` is one of the fastest ways a VR tool
falls back to a desktop if the UX is not handled deliberately.

It suggests a separate donor branch inside `VR-apps-lab`:

- setup and configuration keyboards
- overlay-side text entry
- mixed-reality desk-aware typing
- semantic non-native keyboard components

## Family 19: Hand, palm, radial, and quick-access menus

This family covers the fast-launch and quick-selection surfaces that make VR
tools feel usable without a large persistent desktop metaphor.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `NovaUI-Unity/XRHandMenuSample` | Already studied | Palm-up launcher that opens richer panels at a detached popup anchor |
| `Housz/VRMenuDesigner` | Already studied | Menu-archetype toolkit spanning default, radial, ring, and editor-side modifiers |
| `Oyshoboy/RadialMenuVR` | Already studied | Minimal radial-selection donor with hover scaling and auto-hide |
| `yusufalibrahim1994/UnityXR-Physicalized-Radial-Menu` | Already studied | Radial selection that resolves into real interactables in the hand |
| `auroreRakoto/XR-UI-Prototype` | Already studied | Small menu-list to contextual secondary-panel comparison node |

### Consolidation note

This family points toward a strong `quick-access shell` branch inside
`VR-apps-lab`:

- palm launchers
- radial selectors
- contextual detail panels
- menu archetypes that can be reused across utilities

## Family 20: Spatial UI interaction frameworks and input stacks

This family is less about one finished menu and more about the lower-level
plumbing that makes ordinary UI surfaces usable in XR.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Unity-Technologies/XR-Interaction-Toolkit-Examples` | Already studied | Broad baseline for spatial keyboard, 2D UI, 3D UI, gaze, and toolkit-scale interaction samples |
| `microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity` | Already studied | Legacy but still strong solver-driven hand-menu and prefab-UI donor |
| `MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity` | Not studied deeply | Current-generation MRTK continuation that deserves its own later pass |
| `ViveSoftware/ViveInputUtility-Unity` | Already studied | VR-aware 3D pointer and custom EventSystem input-module donor |
| `Unity-Technologies/mr-example-meta-openxr` | Already studied | Modern Meta/OpenXR sample stack for hand-menu, gesture, and spatial-panel flows |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because many future `VR-apps-lab` tools will not need a new
menu idea as much as they will need a clean `input and UI substrate`.

It strengthens a framework-donor layer around:

- UI EventSystem adaptation
- ray, poke, and hand-input routing
- palm and gesture gating
- toolkit-side keyboard and panel scaffolds

## Family 21: Teleoperation workspaces and embodied control surfaces

This family covers VR applications that behave like control rooms, operator
stations, or embodied dashboards for external systems.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `leggedrobotics/unity_ros_teleoperation` | Already studied | Palm-menu teleoperation shell with ROS-state surfaces and subsystem toggles |
| `h2r/ros_reality` | Already studied | Semantic action-menu reference over a websocket bridge |
| `elpis-lab/UR10_Teleop` | Already studied | Thin controller-pose exporter to an external robot-control process |
| `pollen-robotics/ReachyTeleoperation` | Already studied | Strong staged teleoperation product with connection, mirror, and live-control rooms |
| `nakama-lab/VR_Teleop_Interface` | Not studied deeply | Architectural comparison node for broader teleoperation interface decomposition |
| `h2r/GHOST` | Not studied deeply | Adjacent visualization and gesture-control node worth later comparison |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because it shows a wider product branch than ordinary
utility overlays:

- VR control-room shells
- side-panel and palm-menu command surfaces
- staged setup-to-operation room flows
- thin VR frontends that hand control to an external process

## Family 22: Social overlays, communication sidecars, and companion surfaces

This family covers repositories where the core value is not a generic dashboard
but an ongoing social, speech, or communication workflow that can feed VR
through overlays, `OSC`, `WebSocket`, or desktop companion surfaces.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `designeerlabs/discord-vr` | Already studied | Browser-automation sidecar that turns Discord voice presence into a prefab-driven OpenVR overlay |
| `kittynXR/VRCattoChatto` | Already studied | Desktop-native chat companion with Twitch plus OSC outputs and persisted broadcaster/auth state |
| `Wolf-G88/vrchat-proximity-app` | Already studied | Service-first proximity sidecar with OSC transport and optional SteamVR overlay controls |
| `Sharrnah/whispering` | Partially studied | Broad local speech platform whose VR value comes from OSC and websocket fan-out rather than a single overlay |
| `Hotrian/OpenVRTwitchChat` | Already studied | Twitch-chat overlay reference with a stronger in-headset presentation bias |
| `MeroFune/GOpy` | Not studied deeply | Smaller integration-helper comparison node that may still add another desktop-to-VR communication angle |
| `I5UCC/VRCTextboxSTT` | Already studied | Local speech-to-text helper where the SteamVR overlay is one output surface among others |
| `gt0777/VRCLiveCaptionsMod` | Already studied | App-internal speech surface comparison node from the accessibility and social boundary |
| `rrazgriz/VRCMicOverlay` | Already studied | Minimal status-overlay node for avatar-facing communication state |
| `Larsundso/SteamVR-Discord-Overlay` | Already studied | Rich Discord-local-IPC overlay with message subscriptions, button overlays, and a localhost control dashboard |
| `Artemol/DiscOverlay` | Already studied | Thin Unity shell around the Discord Streamkit voice widget with an in-VR positioning dashboard |
| `imagitama/steamvr-overlay-vrbuddy` | Already studied | Remote companion visualization overlay that renders another person's head and hands in your local playspace |
| `beareogaming/BD-XSOverlay-notify` | Not studied deeply | BetterDiscord plugin that treats an existing external overlay host as the render target for notifications |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because it shows that `communication tooling` is its own VR
utility branch, not just an accessibility afterthought:

- social-presence overlays
- desktop-native chat companions
- service-first speech utilities
- VRChat-facing sidecars with optional overlay control surfaces
- Discord-local-IPC overlays with companion dashboards
- companion-visualization overlays for other people or remote collaborators

## Family 23: Alternative OpenXR runtimes, special-display paths, and platform experiments

This family covers runtime implementations that target nontraditional hardware,
embedded platform contexts, or proof-of-concept runtime architectures rather
than ordinary HMD-first desktop setups.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DisplayXR/displayxr-runtime` | Already studied | Clean layered runtime architecture for spatial displays and 3D monitors |
| `JoeyAnthony/XRGameBridge` | Already studied | Focused runtime wrapper for UEVR-style game flows on special displays |
| `warrenm/OpenXRKit` | Already studied | Embedded Apple-platform OpenXR runtime framework with platform-specific system implementations |
| `rinsuki/FruitXR` | Already studied | Local IPC and runtime-server proof-of-concept for macOS |
| `maximum-game-22/openxr-3d-display` | Not studied deeply | Monado-derived spatial-display comparison node |
| `Kartaverse/OpenDisplayXR` | Not studied deeply | Project cluster around OpenXR paths for nonstandard displays |
| `chnoblouch/aethervr` | Already studied | Webcam-driven custom OpenXR runtime that reinforces the broader nonstandard-runtime branch |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because it expands `runtime research` beyond switchers and
layers into `runtime ownership for nontraditional targets`:

- special-display runtimes
- embedded platform runtimes
- local IPC runtime experiments
- custom runtimes that are better understood as architecture donors than as products

## Family 24: Tracked-device geometry, CAD, and auxiliary tracker tooling

This family covers the point where tracked-device design becomes an explicit
engineering workflow rather than only a pose-ingestion problem.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `fughilli/ViveTrackedDevice` | Partially studied | Documentation-first reverse-engineering donor for Lighthouse-tracked device internals |
| `TriadSemi/Fusion360_SteamVR_Json` | Already studied | CAD-authored path from construction geometry to SteamVR tracking JSON |
| `aughip/augmented-hip` | Already studied | Derived waist-tracker driver built from existing tracked body nodes |
| `m9cd0n9ld/IMU-VR-Full-Body-Tracker` | Already studied | Full-stack DIY tracker ecosystem spanning firmware, desktop tooling, and driver registration |

| `choyai/SteamVRTrackerUtility` | Already studied | Narrow tracker-identity and serial helper for deterministic role workflows |
| `jangxx/UniversalTrackerMarkers` | Already studied | Marker and identity helper that reinforces the auxiliary tracker-tooling side of the family |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `tracked-device work` is not only about network
bridges:

- reverse-engineered device geometry
- CAD authoring for sensor definitions
- derived or synthetic role devices
- auxiliary tracker identity and hardware workflows

## Family 25: Expressive tracking, face and eye input, and avatar-facing bridges

This family covers the branches where the input is not only a body pose but a
more expressive face, eye, hand, or avatar-facing signal that must be adapted
into SteamVR, OpenXR, or avatar-consumer surfaces.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Project-Babble/Baballonia` | Already studied | Cross-platform expressive-tracking host with overlay-assisted calibration and modular capture sources |
| `jcorvinus/HandshakeVR` | Already studied | Hand-provider remapping layer that normalizes incompatible input models |
| `moshimeow/mercury_steamvr_driver` | Already studied | SteamVR hand-driver path built around an out-of-process tracking source |
| `BattleAxeVR/PSVR2_OpenXR_Eye_Tracking` | Already studied | Vendor-specific gaze source translated into standard OpenXR layer surfaces |
| `Nordskog/HandOfLesser` | Already studied | Quest or OpenXR hand-tracking bridge into SteamVR and avatar-facing consumers |
| `mbucchia/OpenXR-Eye-Trackers` | Already studied | OpenXR-side gaze and eye-tracking adaptation donor |
| `pembem22/etvr-openxr-layer` | Already studied | OSC eye-tracking to OpenXR gaze adaptation path |
| `ThatGuyThimo/leapmotion-osc` | Not studied deeply | Finger-only avatar-facing OSC output comparison node |
| `takana-v/quest_steamvr_fbt_tool` | Not studied deeply | Quest-derived body state and avatar-facing export follow-up node |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because it pulls together several adaptation layers that
would otherwise look unrelated:

- overlay-assisted expressive calibration
- hand-provider remapping
- driver plus subprocess expressive input
- vendor-specific gaze adaptation into standard XR surfaces
- avatar-facing exports built on top of those richer inputs

## Family 26: VRChat chatbox, STT, and text-surface sidecars

This family covers utilities whose core job is to get text into VRChat through
chatbox output, avatar parameter surfaces, or compact desktop-side text tools.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `BoiHanny/vrcosc-magicchatbox` | Already studied | Broad modular chatbox composer that squeezes many live status modules into one bounded text surface |
| `ScrapW/Chatbox` | Already studied | Android relay with floating overlay entry surface and configurable local or remote chatbox targets |
| `misyaguziya/VRCT` | Already studied | Tauri and Python translation shell with overlay output, Whisper management, and OSCQuery-aware VRChat delivery |
| `killfrenzy96/KillFrenzyAvatarText` | Already studied | Unity-side installer for avatar text surfaces built around pointer-indexed parameter grids |
| `dbqt/VRCOSCChatbox` | Already studied | Tiny buffered WPF chatbox sender with explicit rate-limited background queue |
| `yum-food/TaSTT` | Already studied | STT-to-avatar text surface built around generated parameter grids and animator assets |

| `Lioncat6/OSC-Chat-Tools` | Already studied | Product-rich monolithic status composer for chatbox-centered utility workflows |
| `I5UCC/VRCTextboxSTT` | Already studied | Thin STT overlap node that keeps speech-to-text inside a focused textbox utility |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `text workflows` in social VR are broader than one
caption or subtitle app:

- character-budgeted status composition
- mobile relay surfaces
- translation and transcription shells over local models and overlays
- avatar text surfaces driven by parameter grids
- patched overlay keyboards for in-VR text entry
- thin textbox or STT micro-utilities
- micro-script donors for one narrow text output

It suggests a stronger product branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- chatbox-sidecar composition
- relay-first handheld chat tools
- translation and transcription shells for social VR
- speech-to-avatar text surfaces
- text-entry helpers for overlay-first workflows

## Family 27: Avatar-facing OSC companions, routers, and consumer automation sidecars

This family covers tools where avatar parameters, headset telemetry, or
VRChat-facing `OSC` become a desktop-service bus for routing, automation, or
consumer actions.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `OscToys/OscGoesBrrr` | Already studied | Broad Electron companion with typed IPC, diagnostics pages, and OSCQuery-aware services |
| `valuef/VRCRouter` | Already studied | Config-driven OSC router with route presets, sidecar launch, and cleanup handling |
| `Sergey004/Quest2-VRC` | Already studied | Plugin-based Quest telemetry host that fans device state into OSC and side integrations |
| `I5UCC/VRCMeeter` | Already studied | Focused avatar-parameter bridge into Voicemeeter actions and profiles |
| `I5UCC/VRCAvatarParameterSync` | Already studied | Snapshot and replay helper for selected avatar parameters across avatar changes |
| `ZenithVal/OSCLeash` | Already studied | Config-driven avatar or physbone sidecar that turns state into control behavior |
| `ZenithVal/OSCLock` | Already studied | Avatar-driven timer and Bluetooth-actuator workflow with a clear desktop safety surface |

| `Krekun/vrchat-mcp-osc` | Already studied | Relay-based automation bridge that exposes VRChat OSC to higher-level MCP tools |
| `regzo2/OSCmooth` | Already studied | Unity-side smoothing and proxy-parameter generator for noisy OSC-driven avatar inputs |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because it turns `avatar-facing OSC` into a broader product
branch than simple parameter export:

- focused routers and sidecar launchers
- diagnostics-rich desktop companion shells
- reusable OSCQuery discovery and auto-connect libraries
- plugin-based telemetry hosts
- AI or automation relays over safer transport boundaries
- avatar parameter bridges into desktop services
- parameter continuity helpers across avatar changes
- consumer automation flows and consumer-side smoothing layers

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- OSC-aware desktop companion shells
- OSCQuery-first discovery helpers
- AI and automation relays into avatar-facing surfaces
- avatar-state automation tools
- headset telemetry hosts with modular consumers

## Family 28: XR-glasses virtual displays, workspace shells, and spatial screen utilities

This family covers repositories that treat special displays, XR glasses, or
head-tracked screens as their main target instead of a conventional VR headset
dashboard.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `wheaney/XRLinuxDriver` | Already studied | Base Linux XR-glasses driver with device backends and feature hooks |
| `wheaney/breezy-desktop` | Already studied | Broad workspace shell over the glasses driver with desktop-environment and Vulkan-mode split |
| `wheaney/decky-XRGaming` | Already studied | SteamOS/Game Mode wrapper over the Breezy and XR driver stack |
| `MolotovCherry/virtual-display-rs` | Already studied | User-session virtual-display service stack with named-pipe IPC and control layers |
| `mgschwan/viture_virtual_display` | Already studied | Capture-to-head-tracked screen utility built around Viture IMU data |
| `lc700x/desktop2stereo` | Already studied | AI depth pipeline that turns ordinary desktop or video content into a stereoscopic screen workflow |
| `wheaney/OpenVR-xrealAirGlassesHMD` | Already studied | Thin OpenVR HMD path that adapts XREAL IMU data into a runtime-facing headset device |
| `iVideoGameBoss/PhoenixHeadTracker` | Already studied | Head-tracking sidecar that exports glasses orientation into opentrack-style or mouse-look consumers |
| `peacepenguin/Virtual-Display-Driver` | Already studied | Generic Windows virtual-display comparison node without glasses-specific shell logic |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `special-display workflows` now look like a real
product branch rather than a pile of isolated driver experiments:

- base hardware drivers for XR glasses
- workspace shells layered on top
- Game Mode or platform-native wrappers
- user-session virtual-display services
- head-tracked screen utilities
- thin runtime-facing HMD paths
- screen-transformation pipelines

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- XR-glasses workspace shells
- runtime-facing glasses device paths
- managed virtual-display service tooling
- spatial screen helpers outside ordinary headset runtime flows

## Family 29: Wearable haptics, tactile bridges, and avatar-driven feedback systems

This family covers software and hardware stacks where avatar events, `OSC`, or
other social-VR signals become tactile output on wearables or repurposed
consumer hardware.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `OpenShock/ShockOSC` | Already studied | Configurable wearable-haptics router with grouped outputs, debug surfaces, and change-tracked OSC values |
| `bhaptics/VRChatOSC` | Already studied | Unity-side avatar setup tooling for bHaptics-driven VRChat wearables |
| `senseshift/senseshift-firmware` | Already studied | Firmware donor for a modular DIY tactile wearable platform |
| `senseshift/senseshift-hardware` | Already studied | Hardware-reference donor paired with the SenseShift firmware ecosystem |
| `Z4urce/VRC-Haptic-Pancake` | Already studied | Multi-transport bridge from VRChat or Resonite into haptic-style outputs |
| `lebaston100/vrc-patpatpat` | Already studied | Sparse contact solver that expands limited avatar receivers into richer actuator placement |
| `shadorki/vrc-owo-suit` | Already studied | Narrow OWO suit bridge with clear avatar contact authoring and intensity grouping |
| `Python1320/vrcjoycon` | Already studied | Consumer-device bridge that repurposes Joy-Con rumble for avatar-facing tactile output |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `wearable haptics` now has enough donor surface to
split into clear layers:

- avatar authoring and editor tooling
- desktop bridge apps and hardware groups
- sparse-contact solver logic
- firmware and hardware reference stacks
- narrow hardware-specific or consumer-device bridges

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- avatar-driven haptics routers
- tactile solver experiments
- DIY wearable platform references

This family is now distinct from the newer
`biometric, neurofeedback, and accessory-control bridges`
branch, which focuses on measurements, host shells, and safety-aware accessory
platforms rather than tactile output specifically.

## Family 30: Playspace editors, boundary importers, and shared-space helpers

This family covers repositories where the main value is not generic
`recentering`, but explicit ownership of room boundaries, playspace transforms,
or shared physical-space awareness.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Xavr0k/ChaperoneTweak` | Already studied | In-headset SteamVR chaperone editor with controller hit-zones for wall and playspace edits |
| `FrostyCoolSlug/xr-chaperone` | Already studied | Desktop setup wizard plus headless OpenXR room-boundary service with polygon-distance fading |
| `Sgeo/Guardian2Chaperone` | Already studied | Vendor-boundary import utility from Oculus Guardian into SteamVR chaperone |

| `LIV/RotatoExpress` | Already studied | Live playspace transform rotator with explicit restore-on-exit behavior |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `room-space tooling` is broader than calibration:

- live in-headset boundary editors
- desktop setup plus service-mode boundary tools
- vendor-boundary import utilities
- runtime local playspace movers
- shared-room peer overlays

## Family 31: Redirected-walking toolkits, locomotion adaptation, and space-redirection research

This family covers repositories that explicitly study, simulate, or implement
ways of adapting user motion to limited physical space.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `USC-ICT-MxR/RDWT` | Already studied | Foundational redirected-walking toolkit with pluggable redirectors, resetters, and simulation manager |
| `yaoling1997/OpenRDW` | Already studied | Expanded redirected-walking research platform with richer configuration, algorithms, and multi-avatar ownership |

| `Knerten0815/VR_Dodge_Study` | Fork / variant only | Thesis-oriented OpenRDW variation focused on dodging and reset research rather than a new mainline platform |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because it separates two related but different answers to
`small-room movement`:

- research-grade redirected-walking platforms
- user-facing locomotion modules with safety or comfort stacks

## Family 32: XR latency measurement, recording parsers, and experiment harnesses

This family covers tools that explicitly measure XR latency, encode signals for
later video alignment, or parse and analyze rich simulator recordings.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `immersivecognition/motion-to-photon-measurement` | Already studied | Unity motion-to-photon harness with combined scene coding and tracked output |
| `vr-thi/VRLate` | Already studied | External hardware latency rig with GPS synchronization, serial capture, and brightness encoding |
| `Greendayle/VR-Motion-to-photon-latency-` | Partially studied | VRChat-world and smartphone slow-motion methodology for low-cost latency checks |
| `HARPLab/dreyevr_recording_analyzer` | Already studied | Parser-plus-notebook stack for rich DReyeVR replay analysis |
| `HARPLab/DReyeVR-parser` | Already studied | Thin standalone parser and cache layer for DReyeVR recordings |
| `ratcave/vrlatency` | Already studied | Scriptable Python latency lab with display, tracking, and total-latency experiment classes |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `XR measurement tooling` is now broader than
generic metrics:

- engine-side visual coding for later alignment
- external hardware latency rigs
- consumer-grade latency methodologies
- replay parsers and notebook analyzers
- reusable experiment-lab frameworks

## Family 33: Simulation telemetry overlays, motion-cueing bridges, and sim-sidecar platforms

This family covers repositories where simulator telemetry becomes the backbone
for overlays, force-feedback sidecars, motion-platform tooling, or broader VR
simulator platforms.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `TinyPedal/TinyPedal` | Already studied | Modular telemetry overlay host with adapters, widget lifecycle control, and preset-aware behavior |
| `walmis/VPforce-TelemFFB` | Already studied | Multi-instance telemetry sidecar that maps simulator state into force-feedback device roles |
| `PHARTGAMES/SpaceMonkey` | Already studied | Telemetry normalization bridge that translates unsupported games into common outputs |
| `SimFeedback/SimFeedback-AC-Servo` | Already studied | Motion-platform ecosystem with telemetry providers and extension facade boundaries |
| `HARPLab/DReyeVR` | Already studied | VR simulator platform with ego sensor, replay pipeline, and research-oriented data streaming |
| `giuseppdimaria/Unity-VRlines` | Partially studied | XR flight-simulator prototype with modular aircraft physics and VR controller mappings |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because mature simulator tooling reinforces several
construction patterns that also matter for `VR-apps-lab`:

- desktop plus overlay host splits
- telemetry-to-device sidecars
- output normalization bridges
- simulator platforms with replay and analytics

## Family 34: Biometric, neurofeedback, and accessory-control bridges

This family covers repositories where biometric measurements, richer biosignal
trees, or avatar-facing `OSC` become the control plane for monitoring,
accessory behavior, or safety-aware sidecar platforms.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Honzackcz/PulsoidToOSC` | Already studied | Thin biometric bridge with OSCQuery-aware discovery, chatbox templating, and multi-client fan-out |
| `nullstalgia/iron-heart` | Already studied | Rich Rust companion shell with BLE or WebSocket inputs, charts, logs, and many output sinks |
| `vard88508/vrc-osc-miband-hrm` | Already studied | Minimal browser-plus-node wearable bridge with multiple parameter encodings |
| `DASPRiD/vrc-osc-manager` | Already studied | Plugin-oriented avatar-facing accessory manager with persisted settings and OSCQuery services |
| `nullstalgia/OpenShock-ESP-Legacy` | Already studied | Embedded ESP32 accessory-control firmware with OSC, browser config, and emergency-stop surfaces |
| `ChilloutCharles/BrainFlowsIntoVRChat` | Already studied | Biosignal pipeline that preserves a nested parameter tree before flattening it into VRChat OSC paths |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because it makes a previously diffuse branch explicit:

- thin wearable or heart-rate bridges
- richer operator-facing biometrics shells
- browser-plus-local wearable relays
- plugin-oriented accessory hosts
- embedded safety-aware controllers
- neurofeedback or biosignal exporters

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- biometric sidecars for avatar-facing consumers
- accessory-control hosts with plugin boundaries
- embedded controller research with explicit safety surfaces
- richer biosignal schemas instead of flat parameter bags

## Recommended synthesis path for `VR-apps-lab`

The next useful step is not another long unsorted list.

It is:

1. build product concepts around `families`, not repos;
2. prioritize deep dives where status is `Partially studied` or
   `Not studied deeply`;
3. keep forks/variants as comparison nodes instead of promoting each one to a
   full standalone research wave.
