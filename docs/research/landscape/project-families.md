# Project Families

- Date: `2026-04-19`
- Goal: reorganize the `VR-apps-lab` research corpus around logical overlap
  families instead of a long flat list of repositories.

## Why this file exists

At this point `VR-apps-lab` already contains:

- a large initial landscape pass;
- multiple follow-up research waves;
- several focused reuse-plan documents;
- deeper passes on under-documented repositories.

The next useful step is not more random expansion. It is `grouping`,
`deduplication by idea`, and understanding which clusters are already mature.

## Status legend

- `Already studied`
  covered well enough across one or more existing docs.
- `Partially studied`
  present in `VR-apps-lab`, but still deserving a dedicated deeper code-level pass.
- `Not studied deeply`
  either missing from the repo or only known through a quick mention.
- `Fork / variant only`
  valuable for comparison, but probably not worth a full standalone deep dive
  before the main upstream is understood.

## Role note

- Use this file for overlap, comparison, and family-level product direction.
- The status labels shown here are mirrored for convenience.
- `../catalog/project-registry.md` remains the canonical owner of per-repo
  status.

## Family 1: OpenXR runtime switchers, inventories, and layer managers

This family is already converging into the future `OpenXR Doctor` direction.

### Consolidation note

This is one of the highest-overlap families in the whole repository. The main
output of this family for `VR-apps-lab` should be a single future product concept:

- `OpenXR Doctor`
- `runtime capability matrix`
- `runtime adapter and bring-up playbook`

## Family 2: SteamVR/OpenVR notification and remote-control overlays

This family centers on letting an external process drive overlay or
notification behavior.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `BOLL7708/OpenVROverlayPipe` | Already studied | Best reference for `server-driven overlay creation` |
| `jeppevinkel/OpenVRNotificationPipe` | Already studied | Focused notification pipe reference |
| `WiiPlayer2/VnotifieR` | Already studied | Local HTTP notification server with config-driven overlay placement and fade behavior |

### Consolidation note

This family points toward a future `VR notification / overlay service bus`
instead of several unrelated mini-tools.

## Family 3: Lighthouse managers and room-state helpers

This is a large family with very high overlap in problem space and very low
need for flat duplication in the index.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `kurotu/OVR-Lighthouse-Manager` | Already studied | One of the main Windows references |
| `DHCPCD9/go-steamvr-lighthouse-manager` | Already studied | Alternate UI/automation angle |

| `risa2000/lh2ctrl` | Already studied | Linux BLE micro-tool for v2 |
| `ugokutennp/watchman-pairing-assistant` | Already studied | GUI wrapper around pairing flows and `lighthouse_console` |

### Consolidation note

This family deserves a later comparative matrix, because the main axis is not
just platform but also:

- `power only`
- `BLE control`
- `room/config backup`
- `SteamVR automation`

## Family 4: Battery and device-monitor utilities

This family has a lot of logical duplication, but it is still useful because it
shows different product scales: tray app, overlay, notification tool, inventory
panel, and logging utility.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `OVRTools/OpenVRDeviceBattery` | Already studied | Strong tray-app and background-helper reference |
| `zeroae/VRBattery` | Already studied | Tiny Qt battery widget rendered into an OpenVR dashboard surface |

| `rhaamo/OpenVR-Display-Devices` | Already studied | Broader device inventory view |
| `copperpixel/steamvrbattery` | Already studied | Minimal CLI property-polling battery monitor |
| `Denwa/vive-wireless-info-overlay` | Not studied deeply | Source-light wireless-temperature micro-overlay whose product framing is stronger than its visible code donor value |

| `mutr/openvr_battery_monitor` | Already studied | Background battery exporter that writes per-device telemetry to InfluxDB |

### Consolidation note

This should become a single `Device Monitor` family inside `VR-apps-lab`, with
sub-modes like:

- wrist/device overlay
- tray/desktop watcher
- notification-only helper
- inventory/detail screen

## Family 5: Virtual tracker, OSC, WebSocket, and bridge tooling

This is one of the most strategically valuable families because it converts
external data into `SteamVR/OpenVR devices`, `pose streams`, or `OSC events`.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|

| `I5UCC/VRCThumbParamsOSC` | Already studied | Configurable SteamVR/XInput-to-VRChat OSC exporter with OSCQuery and auto-launch support |
| `TheNexusAvenger/Enigma` | Not studied deeply | Consumer-side export of SteamVR tracker roles into a non-XR client with a companion plugin path |
| `ThatGuyThimo/leapmotion-osc` | Not studied deeply | Finger-only OSC egress utility adjacent to the hand-tracking and avatar-parameter bridge family |

### Consolidation note

This family is the clearest foundation for a future:

- `Tracker Bridge Service`
- `SteamVR/OSC bridge`
- `external sensor -> virtual tracker` platform
- `engine-side role reuse and direct consumer export`

## Family 6: Desktop and overlay utility suites

| `hiinaspace/vr-notes-anywhere` | Already studied | Projection-overlay note surface that proves annotation can be treated as a tiny scene-state problem instead of a desktop mirror |
| `jacklul/SteamVR-PhasmoMatrix` | Already studied | Ultra-thin website-wrapper overlay whose main value is focused domain packaging, not a broad host shell |
| `SteveMarkhamGIT/SmudgeTimerOpenVR` | Already studied | Wrist-mounted game-status overlay with controller-tip gesture triggering and generated-texture updates |

### Consolidation note

This family should feed a future comparative UX document, not just more
individual project entries. The real overlap axes are:

- `desktop mirror`
- `window portal`
- `wrist/watch controls`
- `dashboard suite`
- `overlay patch micro-tool`
- `media/player overlay`
- `annotation surface`
- `game-specific status surface`
- `Linux vs Windows UX`
- `OpenVR overlay vs OpenXR layer`

## Family 7: Accessibility overlays and assistive HUDs

This family is now clearly large enough to be treated as a first-class product
direction.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Vinventive/live-captions-vr` | Already studied | Speech-to-text overlay reference |
| `MochiDoesVR/OpenVRCaptions` | Already studied | C#/SteamVR captions reference |

| `lukis101/VRPoleOverlay` | Already studied | Spatial-awareness overlay that renders a known room object and borrows chaperone color and height as configuration defaults |

### Consolidation note

This is big enough to be treated as a product family:

- captions
- status hints
- assistive HUDs
- comfort and orientation helpers
- anchored room-awareness overlays

## Family 8: Driver tutorials and custom-device plumbing

This family is less about end-user utilities and more about building the
knowledge needed for `device-side tooling`.

- `synthetic controller and input-emulation sidecars`
- `pose rewriting and motion-manipulation drivers`
- `domain-specific hardware bridges`
- `virtual display and repurposed output drivers`

## Family 9: Vendor enhancement and mod layers

These projects are especially useful because they sit `on top of` official
vendor stacks instead of replacing them.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `BnuuySolutions/PSVR2Toolkit` | Already studied | Vendor-driver wrapper with versioned IPC for gaze data and trigger-effect control |

| `PSVR2-related forks/variants` | Not studied deeply | Worth mapping later if this branch expands |

### Consolidation note

This family supports a future `vendor enhancement` research direction:

- augment official stack
- keep vendor runtime intact
- expose extra features through utility-side APIs

## Family 10: Compatibility layers and runtime translation

These projects sit between incompatible or competing runtime ecosystems and are
valuable for understanding translation, emulation, and compatibility shims.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `QuestCraftPlusPlus/OpenComposite` | Already studied | Main OpenVR-to-OpenXR compatibility reference |
| `Supreeeme/xrizer` | Already studied | Alternate OpenVR-on-OpenXR direction |

| `terminal29/OSVR-SteamVR-Bridge` | Already studied | Smaller alias-mapping comparison node for the same OSVR-to-SteamVR bridge family |

### Consolidation note

This family matters less as a direct product target and more as a source of:

- translation-layer architecture
- runtime compatibility patterns
- install and registration models

## Family 11: Performance, rendering, and post-process tooling

This family is about image processing, foveation, scaling, and rendering-side
instrumentation rather than overlays or device control.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `fholger/vrperfkit` | Already studied | Main donor for D3D11 post-process patterns |
| `fholger/openvr_fsr` | Already studied | Earlier, smaller reference for the same lineage |

### Consolidation note

This family should feed:

- GPU-side processing ideas
- future texture-path upgrades
- foveation and eye-tracking experimentation

## Family 12: Passthrough, reality layers, and camera experiments

This family matters because it covers real-world view, passthrough, and
camera-adjacent utility directions, even though not all projects are practical
product donors for current target hardware.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Rectus/openxr-steamvr-passthrough` | Already studied | Closest PC/SteamVR architectural analogue to the original idea |
| `zhangxuelei86/WMR-Passthrough` | Already studied | OpenXR API-layer plus camera-service pattern |

| `jangxx/LeapOVRPassthrough` | Already studied | Gesture-triggered passthrough UX reference |
| `alexander-clarke/openvr-room-mapping` | Already studied | Pose-plus-image capture pipeline that sits between environment reconstruction and alignment research |

### Consolidation note

This family is now best treated as:

- `research and experimentation`
- `external camera / scoped passthrough` inspiration

rather than a guaranteed production direction.

## Family 13: Creator tools, capture, metrics, and workflow utilities

These projects are more about recording, inspection, workflow support, and
creator-facing XR use than about simple end-user overlays.

| `kuentzel/ROVER` | Already studied | Standalone questionnaire and study station whose overlay manager, operator UI, and importable study schema matter more than any one screen |

### Consolidation note

This family supports a separate `creator and diagnostics` branch inside
`VR-apps-lab`, not just consumer-facing overlays.

It also strengthens a smaller but useful sub-branch:

- screenshot workflow helpers
- creator micro-automation tools
- remote-triggered capture flows
- creator control surfaces
- standalone study stations

## Family 14: Overlay implementation references and host scaffolds

| `hiinaspace/godot-openvr-overlay` | Already studied | Godot-native projection-overlay extension that exposes tracker poses, action state, and stereo eye submission through an XR interface |
| `ondorela/OpenVROverlay_imgui` | Already studied | Small D3D11 plus ImGui sample showing direct overlay-event forwarding into the UI stack |
| `thomasmo/SampleVRO` | Already studied | Explicit Win32 plus D3D11 texture-to-overlay sample with forwarded keyboard or pointer interaction |
| `ovrlay/LibOverlay` | Already studied | Minimal Unity helper over raw OpenVR overlay calls with tracked-device attachment and texture refresh |
| `Marlamin/VROverlayTest` | Not studied deeply | Additional D3D11 overlay scratchpad that may matter only if a future pass needs an even thinner Windows baseline |
| `ephemeral-laboratories/ComposeVR` | Not studied deeply | Prototype of rendering Jetpack Compose into an OpenVR overlay, useful mainly if a future pass needs `Compose-style UI -> overlay texture` |

### Consolidation note

This family should feed `VR-apps-lab` as a methods donor layer:

- overlay lifecycle references
- graphics-path references
- UI stack references
- host-scene and render-loop scaffolds
- overlay patch helpers
- engine-side overlay extension hooks
- engine-native projection-overlay extensions
- UI-to-texture bridges with explicit event forwarding

## Family 15: SteamVR environment helpers and runtime hygiene tools

These utilities improve the way SteamVR behaves around startup, dashboard
interaction, distortion, or overlay-heavy workflows.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `MuffinTastic/steamvr-exconfig` | Already studied | Backup-safe config patcher for disabling autolaunch apps and always-active drivers before startup |
| `BnuuySolutions/OculusKiller` | Already studied | Vendor-shell replacement that redirects Oculus launch flow into SteamVR |
| `username223/SteamVRNoHeadset` | Already studied | Null-driver and no-HMD recipe for SteamVR workflows |
| `n1ckfg/ViveTrackerExample` | Already studied | Tracker-without-HMD workflow and tiny Unity helper |

| `sencercoltu/steamvr-undistort` | Already studied | Lens distortion adjustment tool for custom optics |
| `elvissteinjr/SteamVR-VoidScene` | Already studied | Minimal scene app to lower baseline cost for overlay use |
| `shieldmeidunn/SteamVRNullFlipper` | Already studied | Tiny backup-aware helper for flipping SteamVR into null-driver mode |

| `DavidRisch/steamvr_utils` | Already studied | Linux helper collection with a SteamVR lifecycle daemon, base-station power control, and audio switching |

### Consolidation note

This family points toward a separate `environment helper` track inside
`VR-apps-lab`, not just overlays:

- tray toggles
- dashboard fixes
- scene-host helpers
- compositor and distortion helpers
- headsetless/null-driver helpers
- vendor-shell redirects and focused config patchers
- validation and lint micro-tools
- backup-safe config patchers

## Family 17: Calibration, motion compensation, and tracking alignment

These projects are unified by one practical problem: helping the user keep
different tracking spaces, poses, or sensors aligned enough to remain usable.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pushrax/OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator` | Already studied | Foundational mixed-space calibration reference |
| `Stavdel/OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator` | Already studied | Fork line preserved mainly for historical comparison |
| `Marshall-vak/OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator2` | Already studied | Continuous-calibration extension of the SpaceCalibrator idea |
| `BuzzteeBear/OpenXR-MotionCompensation` | Already studied | OpenXR-side motion compensation and calibration flow |
| `openvrmc/OpenVR-MotionCompensation` | Already studied | Driver-side pose rewrite plus dashboard configuration path |
| `RedHawk989/EyeTrackVR-OpenVR-Calibration-Overlay` | Already studied | Minimal overlay-first 9-point eye-tracking calibration surface |
| `alexander-clarke/openvr-room-mapping` | Already studied | Spatial capture and reconstruction path that overlaps with alignment and room-space research |
| `tobexeon/PSVR2EyeTrackingCalibration` | Not studied deeply | Real-time PSVR2 eye-calibration client that currently depends on a custom toolkit fork |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because the best tracking helper is often not a new sensor
or a new driver, but a better `alignment UX`:

- guided point sequences
- overlay-first feedback
- persistent offsets
- continuous correction
- pose-rewrite layers and drivers
- capture-driven alignment artifacts

## Family 16: Vision-based tracking, hand-input bridges, and headsetless camera runtimes

This family covers repositories that use cameras, computer vision,
hand-tracking services, or foreign runtimes to generate SteamVR devices or
OpenXR substitute inputs without relying on classic lighthouse-tracked
controller stacks.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ultraleap/driver_ultraleap` | Already studied | Mature hardware-service to SteamVR hand-driver path with optional elbow trackers and a `DebugRequest` external-input hook |
| `Nordskog/HandOfLesser` | Already studied | Quest/OpenXR hand-tracking bridge into SteamVR and VRChat with structured packets plus named-pipe and UDP transport |
| `NovaAshwolfDev/HandCameraDriver` | Already studied | Archived webcam-hand-tracking WIP with a Python-sidecar plus custom SteamVR driver split |
| `KinectToVR/KinectToVR` | Already studied | Legacy multi-process Kinect and PSMove full-body stack with heavy calibration and tracker-orientation math |
| `KinectToVR/Amethyst` | Already studied | Plugin-based body-tracking host with device plugins and service-endpoint contracts |
| `ju1ce/Mediapipe-VR-Fullbody-Tracking` | Already studied | Single-camera body tracking with switchable SteamVR-driver and VRChat OSC backends plus Quest-friendly WebUI |
| `Wunder-Wulfe/NVIDIA-BodyTracking` | Already studied | GPU-assisted camera body-tracking driver with overlay-assisted alignment and dense tracker-role configuration |
| `chnoblouch/aethervr` | Already studied | Webcam-driven custom OpenXR runtime with a Python tracker connected over local TCP |
| `MasonSakai/VR-AI-Full-Body-Tracking` | Not studied deeply | Camera FBT comparison node still partly anchored in an InputEmulator-era transition |

### Consolidation note

This family shows that `vision-driven XR utility design` is now large enough to
split into several repeatable sub-branches:

- `service-backed hand drivers`
- `camera CV sidecars with SteamVR or OSC backends`
- `legacy tracker apps evolving into plugin platforms`
- `headsetless camera runtimes`

The strongest future product concepts suggested by this family are:

- `vision tracking sandbox`
- `driver/backend-agnostic tracking bridge`
- `headsetless camera QA runtime`

## Family 18: Text entry, tracked keyboards, and non-native input surfaces

This family covers the UI surfaces that let a VR utility collect text or short
commands without bouncing the user back to a desktop monitor.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `campfireunion/VRKeys` | Already studied | Focused drum-style keyboard with validation-aware lifecycle, layout switching, and hand-attached mallets |
| `ultraleap/XR-Keyboard` | Already studied | Physical keyboard generator with prefab, manager, and keymap split |
| `oculus-samples/Unity-TrackedKeyboard` | Already studied | Tracked hardware keyboard sample with hand-proximity reveal and MR desk context |
| `Ayfel/MRTK-Keyboard` | Already studied | Semantic non-native keyboard with multiple layout modes and host-facing callbacks |
| `RTUITLab/Oculus-HandTracking-Keyboard` | Already studied | Lightweight fingertip-driven hand-tracking keyboard experiment |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `text entry` is one of the fastest ways a VR tool
falls back to a desktop if the UX is not handled deliberately.

It suggests a separate donor branch inside `VR-apps-lab`:

- setup and configuration keyboards
- overlay-side text entry
- mixed-reality desk-aware typing
- semantic non-native keyboard components

## Family 19: Hand, palm, radial, and quick-access menus

This family covers the fast-launch and quick-selection surfaces that make VR
tools feel usable without a large persistent desktop metaphor.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `NovaUI-Unity/XRHandMenuSample` | Already studied | Palm-up launcher that opens richer panels at a detached popup anchor |
| `Housz/VRMenuDesigner` | Already studied | Menu-archetype toolkit spanning default, radial, ring, and editor-side modifiers |
| `Oyshoboy/RadialMenuVR` | Already studied | Minimal radial-selection donor with hover scaling and auto-hide |
| `yusufalibrahim1994/UnityXR-Physicalized-Radial-Menu` | Already studied | Radial selection that resolves into real interactables in the hand |
| `auroreRakoto/XR-UI-Prototype` | Already studied | Small menu-list to contextual secondary-panel comparison node |

### Consolidation note

This family points toward a strong `quick-access shell` branch inside
`VR-apps-lab`:

- palm launchers
- radial selectors
- contextual detail panels
- menu archetypes that can be reused across utilities

## Family 20: Spatial UI interaction frameworks and input stacks

This family is less about one finished menu and more about the lower-level
plumbing that makes ordinary UI surfaces usable in XR.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Unity-Technologies/XR-Interaction-Toolkit-Examples` | Already studied | Broad baseline for spatial keyboard, 2D UI, 3D UI, gaze, and toolkit-scale interaction samples |
| `microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity` | Already studied | Legacy but still strong solver-driven hand-menu and prefab-UI donor |
| `MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity` | Not studied deeply | Current-generation MRTK continuation that deserves its own later pass |
| `ViveSoftware/ViveInputUtility-Unity` | Already studied | VR-aware 3D pointer and custom EventSystem input-module donor |
| `Unity-Technologies/mr-example-meta-openxr` | Already studied | Modern Meta/OpenXR sample stack for hand-menu, gesture, and spatial-panel flows |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because many future `VR-apps-lab` tools will not need a new
menu idea as much as they will need a clean `input and UI substrate`.

It strengthens a framework-donor layer around:

- UI EventSystem adaptation
- ray, poke, and hand-input routing
- palm and gesture gating
- toolkit-side keyboard and panel scaffolds

## Family 21: Teleoperation workspaces and embodied control surfaces

This family covers VR applications that behave like control rooms, operator
stations, or embodied dashboards for external systems.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `leggedrobotics/unity_ros_teleoperation` | Already studied | Palm-menu teleoperation shell with ROS-state surfaces and subsystem toggles |
| `h2r/ros_reality` | Already studied | Semantic action-menu reference over a websocket bridge |
| `elpis-lab/UR10_Teleop` | Already studied | Thin controller-pose exporter to an external robot-control process |
| `pollen-robotics/ReachyTeleoperation` | Already studied | Strong staged teleoperation product with connection, mirror, and live-control rooms |
| `nakama-lab/VR_Teleop_Interface` | Not studied deeply | Architectural comparison node for broader teleoperation interface decomposition |
| `h2r/GHOST` | Not studied deeply | Adjacent visualization and gesture-control node worth later comparison |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because it shows a wider product branch than ordinary
utility overlays:

- VR control-room shells
- side-panel and palm-menu command surfaces
- staged setup-to-operation room flows
- thin VR frontends that hand control to an external process

## Family 22: Social overlays, communication sidecars, and companion surfaces

This family covers repositories where the core value is not a generic dashboard
but an ongoing social, speech, or communication workflow that can feed VR
through overlays, `OSC`, `WebSocket`, or desktop companion surfaces.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `designeerlabs/discord-vr` | Already studied | Browser-automation sidecar that turns Discord voice presence into a prefab-driven OpenVR overlay |
| `kittynXR/VRCattoChatto` | Already studied | Desktop-native chat companion with Twitch plus OSC outputs and persisted broadcaster/auth state |
| `Wolf-G88/vrchat-proximity-app` | Already studied | Service-first proximity sidecar with OSC transport and optional SteamVR overlay controls |
| `Sharrnah/whispering` | Partially studied | Broad local speech platform whose VR value comes from OSC and websocket fan-out rather than a single overlay |
| `Hotrian/OpenVRTwitchChat` | Already studied | Twitch-chat overlay reference with a stronger in-headset presentation bias |
| `MeroFune/GOpy` | Not studied deeply | Smaller integration-helper comparison node that may still add another desktop-to-VR communication angle |
| `I5UCC/VRCTextboxSTT` | Already studied | Local speech-to-text helper where the SteamVR overlay is one output surface among others |
| `gt0777/VRCLiveCaptionsMod` | Already studied | App-internal speech surface comparison node from the accessibility and social boundary |
| `rrazgriz/VRCMicOverlay` | Already studied | Minimal status-overlay node for avatar-facing communication state |
| `Larsundso/SteamVR-Discord-Overlay` | Already studied | Rich Discord-local-IPC overlay with message subscriptions, button overlays, and a localhost control dashboard |
| `Artemol/DiscOverlay` | Already studied | Thin Unity shell around the Discord Streamkit voice widget with an in-VR positioning dashboard |
| `imagitama/steamvr-overlay-vrbuddy` | Already studied | Remote companion visualization overlay that renders another person's head and hands in your local playspace |
| `beareogaming/BD-XSOverlay-notify` | Not studied deeply | BetterDiscord plugin that treats an existing external overlay host as the render target for notifications |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because it shows that `communication tooling` is its own VR
utility branch, not just an accessibility afterthought:

- social-presence overlays
- desktop-native chat companions
- service-first speech utilities
- VRChat-facing sidecars with optional overlay control surfaces
- Discord-local-IPC overlays with companion dashboards
- companion-visualization overlays for other people or remote collaborators

## Family 23: Alternative OpenXR runtimes, special-display paths, and platform experiments

This family covers runtime implementations that target nontraditional hardware,
embedded platform contexts, or proof-of-concept runtime architectures rather
than ordinary HMD-first desktop setups.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DisplayXR/displayxr-runtime` | Already studied | Clean layered runtime architecture for spatial displays and 3D monitors |
| `JoeyAnthony/XRGameBridge` | Already studied | Focused runtime wrapper for UEVR-style game flows on special displays |
| `warrenm/OpenXRKit` | Already studied | Embedded Apple-platform OpenXR runtime framework with platform-specific system implementations |
| `rinsuki/FruitXR` | Already studied | Local IPC and runtime-server proof-of-concept for macOS |
| `maximum-game-22/openxr-3d-display` | Not studied deeply | Monado-derived spatial-display comparison node |
| `Kartaverse/OpenDisplayXR` | Not studied deeply | Project cluster around OpenXR paths for nonstandard displays |
| `chnoblouch/aethervr` | Already studied | Webcam-driven custom OpenXR runtime that reinforces the broader nonstandard-runtime branch |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because it expands `runtime research` beyond switchers and
layers into `runtime ownership for nontraditional targets`:

- special-display runtimes
- embedded platform runtimes
- local IPC runtime experiments
- custom runtimes that are better understood as architecture donors than as products

## Family 24: Tracked-device geometry, CAD, and auxiliary tracker tooling

This family covers the point where tracked-device design becomes an explicit
engineering workflow rather than only a pose-ingestion problem.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `fughilli/ViveTrackedDevice` | Partially studied | Documentation-first reverse-engineering donor for Lighthouse-tracked device internals |
| `TriadSemi/Fusion360_SteamVR_Json` | Already studied | CAD-authored path from construction geometry to SteamVR tracking JSON |
| `aughip/augmented-hip` | Already studied | Derived waist-tracker driver built from existing tracked body nodes |
| `m9cd0n9ld/IMU-VR-Full-Body-Tracker` | Already studied | Full-stack DIY tracker ecosystem spanning firmware, desktop tooling, and driver registration |

| `choyai/SteamVRTrackerUtility` | Already studied | Narrow tracker-identity and serial helper for deterministic role workflows |
| `jangxx/UniversalTrackerMarkers` | Already studied | Marker and identity helper that reinforces the auxiliary tracker-tooling side of the family |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `tracked-device work` is not only about network
bridges:

- reverse-engineered device geometry
- CAD authoring for sensor definitions
- derived or synthetic role devices
- auxiliary tracker identity and hardware workflows

## Family 25: Expressive tracking, face and eye input, and avatar-facing bridges

This family covers the branches where the input is not only a body pose but a
more expressive face, eye, hand, or avatar-facing signal that must be adapted
into SteamVR, OpenXR, or avatar-consumer surfaces.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Project-Babble/Baballonia` | Already studied | Cross-platform expressive-tracking host with overlay-assisted calibration and modular capture sources |
| `jcorvinus/HandshakeVR` | Already studied | Hand-provider remapping layer that normalizes incompatible input models |
| `moshimeow/mercury_steamvr_driver` | Already studied | SteamVR hand-driver path built around an out-of-process tracking source |
| `BattleAxeVR/PSVR2_OpenXR_Eye_Tracking` | Already studied | Vendor-specific gaze source translated into standard OpenXR layer surfaces |
| `Nordskog/HandOfLesser` | Already studied | Quest or OpenXR hand-tracking bridge into SteamVR and avatar-facing consumers |
| `mbucchia/OpenXR-Eye-Trackers` | Already studied | OpenXR-side gaze and eye-tracking adaptation donor |
| `pembem22/etvr-openxr-layer` | Already studied | OSC eye-tracking to OpenXR gaze adaptation path |
| `ThatGuyThimo/leapmotion-osc` | Not studied deeply | Finger-only avatar-facing OSC output comparison node |
| `takana-v/quest_steamvr_fbt_tool` | Not studied deeply | Quest-derived body state and avatar-facing export follow-up node |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because it pulls together several adaptation layers that
would otherwise look unrelated:

- overlay-assisted expressive calibration
- hand-provider remapping
- driver plus subprocess expressive input
- vendor-specific gaze adaptation into standard XR surfaces
- avatar-facing exports built on top of those richer inputs

## Family 26: VRChat chatbox, STT, and text-surface sidecars

This family covers utilities whose core job is to get text into VRChat through
chatbox output, avatar parameter surfaces, or compact desktop-side text tools.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `BoiHanny/vrcosc-magicchatbox` | Already studied | Broad modular chatbox composer that squeezes many live status modules into one bounded text surface |
| `ScrapW/Chatbox` | Already studied | Android relay with floating overlay entry surface and configurable local or remote chatbox targets |
| `misyaguziya/VRCT` | Already studied | Tauri and Python translation shell with overlay output, Whisper management, and OSCQuery-aware VRChat delivery |
| `killfrenzy96/KillFrenzyAvatarText` | Already studied | Unity-side installer for avatar text surfaces built around pointer-indexed parameter grids |
| `dbqt/VRCOSCChatbox` | Already studied | Tiny buffered WPF chatbox sender with explicit rate-limited background queue |
| `yum-food/TaSTT` | Already studied | STT-to-avatar text surface built around generated parameter grids and animator assets |

| `Lioncat6/OSC-Chat-Tools` | Already studied | Product-rich monolithic status composer for chatbox-centered utility workflows |
| `I5UCC/VRCTextboxSTT` | Already studied | Thin STT overlap node that keeps speech-to-text inside a focused textbox utility |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `text workflows` in social VR are broader than one
caption or subtitle app:

- character-budgeted status composition
- mobile relay surfaces
- translation and transcription shells over local models and overlays
- avatar text surfaces driven by parameter grids
- patched overlay keyboards for in-VR text entry
- thin textbox or STT micro-utilities
- micro-script donors for one narrow text output

It suggests a stronger product branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- chatbox-sidecar composition
- relay-first handheld chat tools
- translation and transcription shells for social VR
- speech-to-avatar text surfaces
- text-entry helpers for overlay-first workflows

## Family 27: Avatar-facing OSC companions, routers, and consumer automation sidecars

This family covers tools where avatar parameters, headset telemetry, or
VRChat-facing `OSC` become a desktop-service bus for routing, automation, or
consumer actions.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `OscToys/OscGoesBrrr` | Already studied | Broad Electron companion with typed IPC, diagnostics pages, and OSCQuery-aware services |
| `valuef/VRCRouter` | Already studied | Config-driven OSC router with route presets, sidecar launch, and cleanup handling |
| `Sergey004/Quest2-VRC` | Already studied | Plugin-based Quest telemetry host that fans device state into OSC and side integrations |
| `I5UCC/VRCMeeter` | Already studied | Focused avatar-parameter bridge into Voicemeeter actions and profiles |
| `I5UCC/VRCAvatarParameterSync` | Already studied | Snapshot and replay helper for selected avatar parameters across avatar changes |
| `ZenithVal/OSCLeash` | Already studied | Config-driven avatar or physbone sidecar that turns state into control behavior |
| `ZenithVal/OSCLock` | Already studied | Avatar-driven timer and Bluetooth-actuator workflow with a clear desktop safety surface |

| `Krekun/vrchat-mcp-osc` | Already studied | Relay-based automation bridge that exposes VRChat OSC to higher-level MCP tools |
| `regzo2/OSCmooth` | Already studied | Unity-side smoothing and proxy-parameter generator for noisy OSC-driven avatar inputs |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because it turns `avatar-facing OSC` into a broader product
branch than simple parameter export:

- focused routers and sidecar launchers
- diagnostics-rich desktop companion shells
- reusable OSCQuery discovery and auto-connect libraries
- plugin-based telemetry hosts
- AI or automation relays over safer transport boundaries
- avatar parameter bridges into desktop services
- parameter continuity helpers across avatar changes
- consumer automation flows and consumer-side smoothing layers

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- OSC-aware desktop companion shells
- OSCQuery-first discovery helpers
- AI and automation relays into avatar-facing surfaces
- avatar-state automation tools
- headset telemetry hosts with modular consumers

## Family 28: XR-glasses virtual displays, workspace shells, and spatial screen utilities

This family covers repositories that treat special displays, XR glasses, or
head-tracked screens as their main target instead of a conventional VR headset
dashboard.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `wheaney/XRLinuxDriver` | Already studied | Base Linux XR-glasses driver with device backends and feature hooks |
| `wheaney/breezy-desktop` | Already studied | Broad workspace shell over the glasses driver with desktop-environment and Vulkan-mode split |
| `wheaney/decky-XRGaming` | Already studied | SteamOS/Game Mode wrapper over the Breezy and XR driver stack |
| `MolotovCherry/virtual-display-rs` | Already studied | User-session virtual-display service stack with named-pipe IPC and control layers |
| `mgschwan/viture_virtual_display` | Already studied | Capture-to-head-tracked screen utility built around Viture IMU data |
| `lc700x/desktop2stereo` | Already studied | AI depth pipeline that turns ordinary desktop or video content into a stereoscopic screen workflow |
| `wheaney/OpenVR-xrealAirGlassesHMD` | Already studied | Thin OpenVR HMD path that adapts XREAL IMU data into a runtime-facing headset device |
| `iVideoGameBoss/PhoenixHeadTracker` | Already studied | Head-tracking sidecar that exports glasses orientation into opentrack-style or mouse-look consumers |
| `peacepenguin/Virtual-Display-Driver` | Already studied | Generic Windows virtual-display comparison node without glasses-specific shell logic |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `special-display workflows` now look like a real
product branch rather than a pile of isolated driver experiments:

- base hardware drivers for XR glasses
- workspace shells layered on top
- Game Mode or platform-native wrappers
- user-session virtual-display services
- head-tracked screen utilities
- thin runtime-facing HMD paths
- screen-transformation pipelines

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- XR-glasses workspace shells
- runtime-facing glasses device paths
- managed virtual-display service tooling
- spatial screen helpers outside ordinary headset runtime flows

## Family 29: Wearable haptics, tactile bridges, and avatar-driven feedback systems

This family covers software and hardware stacks where avatar events, `OSC`, or
other social-VR signals become tactile output on wearables or repurposed
consumer hardware.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `OpenShock/ShockOSC` | Already studied | Configurable wearable-haptics router with grouped outputs, debug surfaces, and change-tracked OSC values |
| `bhaptics/VRChatOSC` | Already studied | Unity-side avatar setup tooling for bHaptics-driven VRChat wearables |
| `senseshift/senseshift-firmware` | Already studied | Firmware donor for a modular DIY tactile wearable platform |
| `senseshift/senseshift-hardware` | Already studied | Hardware-reference donor paired with the SenseShift firmware ecosystem |
| `Z4urce/VRC-Haptic-Pancake` | Already studied | Multi-transport bridge from VRChat or Resonite into haptic-style outputs |
| `lebaston100/vrc-patpatpat` | Already studied | Sparse contact solver that expands limited avatar receivers into richer actuator placement |
| `shadorki/vrc-owo-suit` | Already studied | Narrow OWO suit bridge with clear avatar contact authoring and intensity grouping |
| `Python1320/vrcjoycon` | Already studied | Consumer-device bridge that repurposes Joy-Con rumble for avatar-facing tactile output |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `wearable haptics` now has enough donor surface to
split into clear layers:

- avatar authoring and editor tooling
- desktop bridge apps and hardware groups
- sparse-contact solver logic
- firmware and hardware reference stacks
- narrow hardware-specific or consumer-device bridges

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- avatar-driven haptics routers
- tactile solver experiments
- DIY wearable platform references

This family is now distinct from the newer
`biometric, neurofeedback, and accessory-control bridges`
branch, which focuses on measurements, host shells, and safety-aware accessory
platforms rather than tactile output specifically.

## Family 30: Playspace editors, boundary importers, and shared-space helpers

This family covers repositories where the main value is not generic
`recentering`, but explicit ownership of room boundaries, playspace transforms,
or shared physical-space awareness.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Xavr0k/ChaperoneTweak` | Already studied | In-headset SteamVR chaperone editor with controller hit-zones for wall and playspace edits |
| `FrostyCoolSlug/xr-chaperone` | Already studied | Desktop setup wizard plus headless OpenXR room-boundary service with polygon-distance fading |
| `Sgeo/Guardian2Chaperone` | Already studied | Vendor-boundary import utility from Oculus Guardian into SteamVR chaperone |

| `LIV/RotatoExpress` | Already studied | Live playspace transform rotator with explicit restore-on-exit behavior |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `room-space tooling` is broader than calibration:

- live in-headset boundary editors
- desktop setup plus service-mode boundary tools
- vendor-boundary import utilities
- runtime local playspace movers
- shared-room peer overlays

## Family 31: Redirected-walking toolkits, locomotion adaptation, and space-redirection research

This family covers repositories that explicitly study, simulate, or implement
ways of adapting user motion to limited physical space.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `USC-ICT-MxR/RDWT` | Already studied | Foundational redirected-walking toolkit with pluggable redirectors, resetters, and simulation manager |
| `yaoling1997/OpenRDW` | Already studied | Expanded redirected-walking research platform with richer configuration, algorithms, and multi-avatar ownership |

| `Knerten0815/VR_Dodge_Study` | Fork / variant only | Thesis-oriented OpenRDW variation focused on dodging and reset research rather than a new mainline platform |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because it separates two related but different answers to
`small-room movement`:

- research-grade redirected-walking platforms
- user-facing locomotion modules with safety or comfort stacks

## Family 32: XR latency measurement, recording parsers, and experiment harnesses

This family covers tools that explicitly measure XR latency, encode signals for
later video alignment, or parse and analyze rich simulator recordings.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `immersivecognition/motion-to-photon-measurement` | Already studied | Unity motion-to-photon harness with combined scene coding and tracked output |
| `vr-thi/VRLate` | Already studied | External hardware latency rig with GPS synchronization, serial capture, and brightness encoding |
| `Greendayle/VR-Motion-to-photon-latency-` | Partially studied | VRChat-world and smartphone slow-motion methodology for low-cost latency checks |

| `HARPLab/DReyeVR-parser` | Already studied | Thin standalone parser and cache layer for DReyeVR recordings |
| `ratcave/vrlatency` | Already studied | Scriptable Python latency lab with display, tracking, and total-latency experiment classes |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `XR measurement tooling` is now broader than
generic metrics:

- engine-side visual coding for later alignment
- external hardware latency rigs
- consumer-grade latency methodologies
- replay parsers and notebook analyzers
- reusable experiment-lab frameworks

## Family 33: Simulation telemetry overlays, motion-cueing bridges, and sim-sidecar platforms

This family covers repositories where simulator telemetry becomes the backbone
for overlays, force-feedback sidecars, motion-platform tooling, or broader VR
simulator platforms.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `TinyPedal/TinyPedal` | Already studied | Modular telemetry overlay host with adapters, widget lifecycle control, and preset-aware behavior |
| `walmis/VPforce-TelemFFB` | Already studied | Multi-instance telemetry sidecar that maps simulator state into force-feedback device roles |
| `PHARTGAMES/SpaceMonkey` | Already studied | Telemetry normalization bridge that translates unsupported games into common outputs |
| `SimFeedback/SimFeedback-AC-Servo` | Already studied | Motion-platform ecosystem with telemetry providers and extension facade boundaries |

| `giuseppdimaria/Unity-VRlines` | Partially studied | XR flight-simulator prototype with modular aircraft physics and VR controller mappings |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because mature simulator tooling reinforces several
construction patterns that also matter for `VR-apps-lab`:

- desktop plus overlay host splits
- telemetry-to-device sidecars
- output normalization bridges
- simulator platforms with replay and analytics

## Family 34: Biometric, neurofeedback, and accessory-control bridges

This family covers repositories where biometric measurements, richer biosignal
trees, or avatar-facing `OSC` become the control plane for monitoring,
accessory behavior, or safety-aware sidecar platforms.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Honzackcz/PulsoidToOSC` | Already studied | Thin biometric bridge with OSCQuery-aware discovery, chatbox templating, and multi-client fan-out |
| `nullstalgia/iron-heart` | Already studied | Rich Rust companion shell with BLE or WebSocket inputs, charts, logs, and many output sinks |
| `vard88508/vrc-osc-miband-hrm` | Already studied | Minimal browser-plus-node wearable bridge with multiple parameter encodings |

| `ChilloutCharles/BrainFlowsIntoVRChat` | Already studied | Biosignal pipeline that preserves a nested parameter tree before flattening it into VRChat OSC paths |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because it makes a previously diffuse branch explicit:

- thin wearable or heart-rate bridges
- richer operator-facing biometrics shells
- browser-plus-local wearable relays
- plugin-oriented accessory hosts
- embedded safety-aware controllers
- neurofeedback or biosignal exporters

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- biometric sidecars for avatar-facing consumers
- accessory-control hosts with plugin boundaries
- embedded controller research with explicit safety surfaces
- richer biosignal schemas instead of flat parameter bags

## Family 35: Browser-backed overlay runtimes, web-tech hosts, and UI runtime experiments

This family covers repositories where the interesting overlay boundary lives in
the runtime split itself: native host, browser or web-facing app layer,
offscreen UI renderer, or other declarative runtime that becomes the overlay
surface.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `mekanoe/ovrsalt` | Already studied | Scrapped but unusually clear backend, runtime, and frontend split over shared buffers and process launch |
| `mekanoe/electron-openvr` | Already studied | Minimal offscreen `Electron` window mirrored directly into an `OpenVR` texture |
| `joshperry/ovrly` | Already studied | `CEF` overlay host with per-app daemons, local `HTTP`, and in-page native API hooks |
| `ephemeral-laboratories/ComposeVR` | Already studied | `Compose Multiplatform` experiment that renders declarative UI into a tracked `OpenVR` overlay |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `browser-backed overlays` are no longer one vague
idea. They now split into distinct construction patterns:

- native backend plus browser runtime
- offscreen browser-window mirroring
- browser host plus daemonized app model
- non-browser declarative UI runtime experiments

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- overlay hosts that behave like local runtime platforms
- desktop-first UI runtimes that mirror into VR
- explicit `HTTP` or `IPC` contracts between overlay shell and app logic

## Family 36: Linux overlay control shells, desktop-service panels, and interaction variants

This family covers repositories where Linux desktop or service workflows are
the main value, and where controller interaction plus desktop-side debug modes
matter as much as the visible VR panel.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `galister/OVR4X11` | Already studied | Linux screen-control shell with `X11` capture, controller pointer logic, and on-overlay keyboard helpers |
| `DrogonMar/SVRLinuxTools` | Already studied | `Qt` or KDE-style overlay shell hosting multiple desktop-service panels with a useful `--novr` mode |
| `Dragon092/OpenVR_Audio_Manager` | Already studied | Focused `Qt` dashboard for HMD-aware audio routing and persisted device preferences |
| `CrispyPin/sinpin-vr` | Not studied deeply | GitHub relocation stub that points to a moved Linux overlay project rather than exposing a useful code donor on GitHub today |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `Linux overlay shells` expose several lessons that
are easy to miss in Windows-heavy donor pools:

- desktop capture plus controller-mouse interaction
- service-panel hosts rather than one fixed tool
- narrow device-manager overlays with explicit preference state
- non-VR debug paths as a maintainability feature

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- Linux-side desktop-control overlays
- service-panel shells with desktop fallback
- stateful routing or inventory dashboards

## Family 37: Micro-overlays, timed status surfaces, and plugin-fed informational display helpers

This family covers repositories where the main value comes from one small
overlay with one strong job: comfort control, timer state, informational feed,
or a note surface rather than a broad dashboard host.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `R-VUt/OVRBrightnessAPI` | Already studied | Tiny comfort overlay exposed through local `HTTP` and `OSC` control planes |
| `CorvinRyder/VR-Slideshow-Overlay` | Already studied | Provider-fed informational surface with multiple outputs including overlay, chatbox, and file |
| `Podshot/VRSessionTimer` | Already studied | Timer overlay that escalates from passive HUD into notifications and restart loops |
| `Yukiiro-Nite/notebook-vr-overlay` | Partially studied | Rough note-surface prototype with explicit overlay event plumbing but incomplete writing workflow |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because it makes `small overlays` much more structured:

- tiny local-control-plane overlays
- provider-fed informational surfaces
- timed reminder or escalation overlays
- rough note or writing lower-bound prototypes

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- automation-friendly micro-overlays
- provider-driven status surfaces
- reminder and intervention overlays
- note or annotation overlays with explicit small state models

## Family 38: Embodied locomotion overlays, live tuning surfaces, and external-device control panels

This family covers repositories where the overlay is not just informational.
It actively shapes movement, live tuning, or control of remote hardware.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `hiinaspace/bikeheadvr` | Already studied | Controllerless locomotion overlay that maps tracker motion and gaze interaction into avatar-facing movement intent |
| `MartyDude20/Omni-Tune` | Already studied | Desktop profile editor mirrored into a live VR tuning surface through a native helper |
| `OpenShock/OVR-Shock` | Already studied | Modern remote-device control overlay with persisted config, API client, and hand-aware interaction |
| `OpenShock/VROverlay` | Partially studied | Older Unity lineage node for the same device-control branch |
| `NewChromantics/PopExposeXr` | Not studied deeply | Thin follow-up node hinting at XR state exposure, but too sparse for mainline promotion |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because it separates several stronger `control-first`
overlay answers from ordinary dashboard surfaces:

- embodied locomotion overlays
- desktop-first editor plus live VR tuning
- remote-device control panels
- lineage comparisons between older and newer overlay hosts

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- embodied-control surfaces
- live tuning overlays for external rigs or movement systems
- in-headset control panels for remote devices and networked accessories

## Family 39: Code-first overlay scaffolds, projection samples, and window-to-texture baselines

This family covers repositories where the main value is not the final product
surface, but the explicit low-level path from pixels, transforms, or desktop
capture into an `OpenVR` overlay.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `stevenjwheeler/OpenGL-VROverlay` | Already studied | Tiny `C` plus rawdraw baseline for controller-attached `OpenVR` texture submission |
| `ChristophHaag/OpenVRWindowOverlay` | Already studied | Linux `X11` window-capture bridge that pushes real app content into an overlay texture |

| `hiinaspace/openvr-overlay-bunny` | Already studied | Projection-overlay donor with explicit per-eye frusta, transform math, and honest runtime caveats |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `overlay implementation reference` should not mean
only big frameworks. The strongest donor lines here are:

- tiny `draw -> texture -> overlay` baselines
- direct `desktop or app window -> overlay` capture bridges
- honest projection-overlay worked examples

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- low-level overlay bring-up references
- window-to-texture overlay utilities
- projection-overlay math and transform notes

## Family 40: Managed-language overlay starters, UIToolkit templates, and higher-level scaffolds

This family covers repositories where the interesting lesson is how a
managed-language or Unity overlay keeps lifecycle, texture transport, and UI
events explicit without dropping back to a tiny native baseline.

| `kurohuku7/zenn-overlay-tutorial` | Not studied deeply | Tutorial-first note for Unity or SteamVR overlay learning rather than a mainline code donor |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `starter overlays` now split more cleanly into:

- reusable Unity UI templates
- desktop-side content feeders for narrow overlays
- managed GPU-interoperable hosts
- broader app-specific scaffolds with local-service dependencies

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- Unity overlay templates with real UI frameworks
- managed-language overlay hosts with explicit texture interop
- higher-level overlay scaffolds that still expose reusable boundaries

## Family 41: Desktop-adjacent companion overlays, phone bridges, and media or text control surfaces

This family covers repositories where the overlay acts as a companion surface
for an external device, desktop workflow, or operator-fed content stream.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `happysmash27/OVR_SLDO` | Already studied | Linux desktop-proxy overlay rooted in shared-memory `X11` capture |
| `Desuuuu/OVRPhoneBridge` | Already studied | Secure phone-companion overlay with encrypted transport, notifications, SMS, and SteamVR keyboard integration |

| `Wulkop/VolumeVR` | Partially studied | `CEF`-backed narrow media or volume shell whose public repo mainly exposes runtime bootstrap logic |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `companion overlays` are not just small dashboard
copies. They now include:

- desktop-proxy surfaces
- secure external-device companions
- operator-authored text or notification tools
- browser-based narrow control shells

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- overlays as companions for phone or desktop workflows
- secure bridge-driven overlay shells
- very small operator tools with one clear value

## Family 42: Specialized effect overlays, visibility shaping, and passthrough cutout surfaces

This family covers repositories where the overlay's main job is a visual
effect, comfort intervention, or spatial cutout rather than ordinary UI.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Alex-J-Lopez/OpenMixerXR` | Already studied | Chroma-key passthrough cutout manager with dashboard editing and controller grab or resize |
| `joaoseabra/SteamVRBlackBarOverlay` | Already studied | Focused HMD-relative top-of-view mask for visibility shaping |

| `RedHawk989/OpenVR-Windows-Activation` | Already studied | Tiny static-image environmental effect overlay |
| `emymin/EmyOverlay` | Not studied deeply | Thin effect-overlay node whose current public donor surface is still too sparse |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `overlay utilities` should include comfort and
perception tools, not only content panels. The strongest lines here are:

- spatial passthrough cutout management
- field-of-view masking
- orientation-aware comfort overlays
- tiny static-image effect surfaces

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- effect-first overlays
- visibility-shaping comfort tools
- passthrough cutout editors and spatial masking surfaces

## Family 43: OpenXR sample apps, rendering baselines, and bring-up references

| `KHeresy/openxr-simple-example` | Already studied | Compact SDL/OpenGL lower-bound sample for minimal bring-up comparisons |
| `jherico/OpenXR-Samples` | Not studied deeply | Useful historical comparison node, but less compelling than the mainline donors in this pass |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `OpenXR sample code` is not one generic donor pool.
It now splits into:

- single-file bootstraps
- structured non-engine sample apps
- desktop-first migration paths
- shared-core sample suites
- minimal graphics lower bounds

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- OpenXR bring-up references
- runtime-facing rendering baselines
- reusable sample-app architecture notes

## Family 44: OpenXR language bindings, generator-backed wrappers, and SDK facades

This family covers repositories where the interesting lesson is how OpenXR is
generated, wrapped, or adapted into another host language while preserving the
runtime-facing API model.

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|

| `FireFlyForLife/rlOpenXR` | Not studied deeply | Wrapper experiment that is more app-facing than binding-system-focused |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `OpenXR bindings` now split more cleanly into:

- layered raw plus ergonomic stacks
- generator-backed scripting facades
- registry-driven managed-language emitters
- build-integrated host-language wrappers

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- OpenXR binding strategies for future tools

- host-language adaptation patterns for XR APIs

## Family 45: OpenVR language bindings, managed wrappers, and scripting access layers

This family covers repositories where the interesting lesson is how OpenVR is
wrapped into another language or runtime while keeping initialization,
subsystem access, and interface ownership understandable.

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `OpenVR access layers` are no longer one vague
category. They now split into:

- typed wrappers
- scripting-first binding stacks
- bridges into other host runtimes
- broader object-oriented runtime facades

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- OpenVR wrappers for fast experimentation
- managed-language runtime facades
- integration patterns that bridge native VR APIs into other ecosystems

## Family 46: OpenVR tracking export, recording, and robotics bridge tooling

This family covers repositories where the main value is not tracking as an end
user feature, but what happens when SteamVR tracking is exported, replayed, or
consumed by other systems.

splits into:

- a mature tracker host
- thin OpenVR-to-OSC exporters
- protocol adapters into an existing host
- skeletal validation utilities
- config-defined input-to-OSC compilers

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- controller-to-OSC compilers
- skeletal-input validation tools

## Family 48: OpenXR platform shells, layer managers, and runtime inspection workbenches

| `haraldsteinlechner/openxr_streamout_layer` | Already studied | Swapchain and frame-hook layer that streams rendered output outward |
| `rAzoR8/openxr-renderdoc-layer` | Already studied | Developer-tool bridge layer that wraps RenderDoc capture around XR frames |
| `fzeruhn/Smoothing-OpenXR-Layer` | Partially studied | Heavier staged frame-intervention pipeline with Vulkan and compute components |

### Consolidation note

This family matters because `OpenXR layers` now split more cleanly into:

- operator-facing per-app micro-layers
- per-app view-shaping and patch layers
- stream-out transport layers
- developer-tool bridge layers
- heavier staged frame-intervention systems

It suggests a stronger branch inside `VR-apps-lab` around:

- per-app OpenXR utility layers
- tool-bridge and transport-bridge API layers
- advanced frame-intervention research

## Recommended synthesis path for `VR-apps-lab`

The next useful step is not another long unsorted list.

It is:

1. build product concepts around `families`, not repos;
2. prioritize deep dives where status is `Partially studied` or
   `Not studied deeply`;
3. keep forks/variants as comparison nodes instead of promoting each one to a
   full standalone research wave.
