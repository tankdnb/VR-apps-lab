# VR Projects Master Index

- Date: `2026-04-18`
- Goal: maintain a single index of VR-related GitHub projects that are useful as
  references, code donors, or product inspiration for `VR-apps-lab`.

This file complements:

- `project-families.md`
- `not-yet-studied-deeply.md`
- `../catalog/project-registry.md`
- `vr-utilities-repo-landscape.md`
- `../reuse/openxr-steamvr-passthrough-reuse-plan.md`
- `../reuse/alvr-reuse-plan.md`
- `../reuse/vrperfkit-reuse-plan.md`

- `vr-projects-wave-14-tracker-ingress-osc-egress-and-role-binding-utilities.md`

## How to use this index

- Use `vr-utilities-repo-landscape.md` for the first big wave of projects
  already reviewed in this repository.
- Use `project-families.md` when you want to reason about
  `logical overlap` and cluster repositories into families rather than browse a
  flat list.
- Use `../catalog/project-registry.md` as the canonical grouped registry of
  tracked repositories.
- Use `not-yet-studied-deeply.md` as the backlog for the
  next code-level and architecture-level research passes.
- Use this file as the combined top-level index that points into the detailed
  wave documents, family maps, registry, and deeper follow-up backlog.
- Use `vr-projects-wave-3-utilities.md` for the next wave centered on utility
  apps, service tools, runtime switchers, and accessibility-focused overlays.
- Use `vr-projects-wave-4-gap-fill.md` for later gap-filling passes that map a
  submitted project list against what is already covered and add the missing
  repositories.
- Use `vr-projects-wave-5-osc-tracking-tools.md` for later niche waves around
  OSC bridges, device markers, marker tracking, room tools, and battery
  utilities.
- Use `vr-projects-wave-6-driver-bridges.md` for driver-centric waves around
  virtual trackers, vendor enhancement tooling, hardware bridges, and runtime
  services.
- Use `vr-projects-wave-7-depth-pass.md` for follow-up deep dives on projects
  that were previously tracked with relatively light coverage.
- Use `vr-projects-foundational-waves-1-7-retro-normalization.md` for the
  canonical repeat deep-pass that normalizes the foundational `waves 1-7`
  corpus to the post-restructure standard used by later waves.
- Use `vr-projects-wave-8-github-source-pass.md` for the first large
  post-restructure GitHub search wave driven by local source clones and
  code-level extraction.
- Use `vr-projects-wave-9-runtime-overlay-devtools.md` for the next wave
  centered on runtime intelligence, headless overlay hosts, dashboard
  micro-utilities, and developer helper tools.
- Use `vr-projects-wave-10-runtime-bridge-and-headsetless-tools.md` for the
  next wave centered on runtime implementations, bridge drivers, headsetless
  workflows, capture bridges, and SteamVR environment helpers.
- Use `vr-projects-wave-11-runtime-adapters-virtual-displays-and-validation.md`
  for the next wave centered on runtime adapters, virtual displays, validation
  helpers, driver examples, and workflow micro-utilities.
- Use `vr-projects-wave-12-synthetic-devices-input-emulation-and-diy-driver-paths.md`
  for the next wave centered on synthetic devices, input-emulation sidecars,
  DIY/custom-hardware drivers, and motion-manipulation paths.
- Use `vr-projects-wave-13-vision-tracking-hand-bridges-and-headsetless-camera-runtimes.md`
  for the next wave centered on vision-based tracking, hand-input bridges, and
  headsetless camera runtimes.
- Use `vr-projects-wave-14-tracker-ingress-osc-egress-and-role-binding-utilities.md`
  for the next wave centered on tracker-ingress drivers, OSC/input export,
  SteamVR role reuse, and direct-to-consumer bridge utilities.
- Treat each project as one of:
  - `code donor`
  - `architecture reference`
  - `product reference`
  - `research only`

  not just mirror-window guesses.
- Interesting ideas:
  split API layers for metrics, efficient binary logging with later CSV export,
  `runtime/app/render/wait` timing separation, D3D11 VRAM and NVIDIA throttle
  data.
- Best reuse value:
  future `OpenXR metrics` and frame-loop diagnostics in `VR-apps-lab`.

  device support.
- Interesting ideas:
  modular driver selection, wide device support surface, open hardware access
  layer.
- Best reuse value:
  hardware experimentation and open device integration research.

  `survive-cli`, raw sensor readout, websocket visualization, fully open
  lighthouse tracking pipeline.
- Best reuse value:
  tracking research, calibration experiments, and custom device tooling.
- Caveat:
  competes with SteamVR for device access, so it is mostly for research and
  tooling workflows.

### 15. `StereoKit/StereoKit`

- What it is:
  easy-to-use XR engine/library for C# and C++ on top of OpenXR.

  clean layer bootstrap flow, shim loading model, extension filtering logic,
  environment-variable activation guidance.
- Best reuse value:
  future `VR-apps-lab` OpenXR API-layer experiments.
- Caveat:
  template only; still needs product logic.
- Sources:
  [repo](https://github.com/Ybalrid/OpenXR-API-Layer-Template)

## Most interesting ideas across all tracked projects

Across both the original landscape and this additional research wave, these are
the strongest reusable ideas.

### 1. Focused overlays beat generic passthrough dreams

The most reusable products are not "full mixed reality", but smaller tools:

- wrist dashboards
- reference windows
- metrics overlays
- cockpit panels
- checklists and notes
- quick actions and hotkeys

The strongest product references here are:

- `DesktopPlus`
- `OpenKneeboard`
- `OpenVR-AdvancedSettings`
- `elite-vr-cockpit`

### 2. OpenXR diagnostics should become a first-class tool

The repo now has enough references to justify a real `OpenXR doctor/debug`
track:

- `openxr-explorer`
- `XRFrameTools`
- `OpenXR-Toolkit`
- `KhronosGroup/OpenXR-SDK-Source`
- `Ybalrid/OpenXR-API-Layer-Template`

### 3. Controller-to-action bridges are very underused

There is clear value in turning VR controller input into:

- keyboard shortcuts
- app commands
- overlay actions
- runtime toggles

Best references:

- `OpenVR2Key`
- `OpenVR-InputEmulator`
- `OpenVR-AdvancedSettings`

### 4. Virtual tracker and calibration tooling is a whole product family

This area has multiple strong donors and product references:

- `OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator`
- `OpenXR-MotionCompensation`
- `PSMoveServiceEx-VMT`
- `libsurvive`
- `tracking-toolkit`

### 5. Metrics and session capture are fertile ground

Good VR tools can help users and developers understand:

- frame timing
- runtime behavior
- tracking quality
- pose history
- device usage

Best references:

- `openvr-metrics`
- `XRFrameTools`
- `clovr`
- `OpenVRDeviceBattery`

### 6. Virtual displays and reference desktops are underrated enablers

If `VR-apps-lab` wants better desktop/reference workflows, these ideas matter:

- `DesktopPlus`
- `WayVR`
- `Virtual-Display-Driver`
- `OpenVRDesktopDisplayPortal`

## Best next additions to VR-apps-lab backlog

Based on the full tracked project set, the highest-value additions are:

1. `OpenXR doctor / runtime inspector`
   inspired by `openxr-explorer`.

2. `VR hotkey bridge`
   inspired by `OpenVR2Key`.

3. `Wrist dashboard + quick actions`
   inspired by `DesktopPlus`, `OpenVR-AdvancedSettings`, and sim overlays.

4. `Reference window / checklist panel`
   inspired by `OpenKneeboard`.

5. `Metrics overlay + logging`
   inspired by `XRFrameTools`, `clovr`, and `openvr-metrics`.

6. `Virtual tracker / OSC bridge`
   inspired by `PSMoveServiceEx-VMT`.

7. `Calibration helper`
   inspired by `OpenXR-MotionCompensation` and `OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator`.

8. `Virtual display workflow`
   inspired by `Virtual-Display-Driver`.

## Bottom line

The repo now has enough external references to support three clear families of
future tools:

- `overlay utilities`
- `diagnostics and developer tools`
- `tracking / calibration / integration helpers`

That is a stronger and more realistic direction for `VR-apps-lab` than continuing to
bet everything on unsupported vendor passthrough paths.
