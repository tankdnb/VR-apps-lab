# Not Yet Studied Deeply

- Date: `2026-04-18`
- Goal: keep a prioritized list of repositories that either:
  - are not yet represented in `VR-apps-lab`;
  - are only lightly covered;
  - or belong to a high-value overlap family that deserves a deeper code-level
    pass.

## How to use this file

For each project, track four things:

- `interesting idea`
- `code donor value`
- `product reference value`
- `what to inspect next`

This keeps the backlog aligned with the existing wave documents and makes it
easier to decide whether the next pass should focus on architecture, UX, or
implementation details.

## Priority batch A

These are the strongest next candidates.

## Family-level gaps that now deserve deeper passes

These are larger than a single repo and should guide the next research wave.

### 1. `Vendor enhancement tooling`

- Main entry: `PSVR2Toolkit`
- Why it matters:
  shows how to augment an official VR stack without fully replacing it.

### 2. `WebSocket-native tracker drivers`

- Main entries:
  `OpenVR-Tracker-Websocket-Driver`, `OpenVR-Driver`
- Why it matters:
  strongest path toward a future `Tracker Bridge Service`.

### 3. `Virtual tracker / OSC platform`

- Main entries:
  `VirtualMotionTracker`, `SteamVR_To_OSC`, `OpenVR2OSC`, `OpenVR-OSC`
- Why it matters:
  turns many scattered utility ideas into one coherent architecture category.

### 4. `Accessibility overlay family`

- Main entries:
  `OpenVRCaptions`, `live-captions-vr`, notification overlays
- Why it matters:
  already proven as a repeatable utility class, not a one-off experiment.

### 5. `Low-level driver learning path`

- Main entries:
  `Simple-OpenVR-Driver-Tutorial`, `opengloves-driver`, `GlassVr`,
  `OpenVR-ArduinoHMD`
- Why it matters:
  the repository has enough device-side references now to justify a dedicated
  learning track.

### 6. `Overlay implementation references and templates`

- Main entries:
  `VROverlay`, `SteamVR-Webkit`, `vr-streaming-overlay`,
  `steamvr_overlay_vulkan`, `VRSceneOverlay`
- Why it matters:
  this is where `VR-apps-lab` can learn concrete overlay construction techniques
  across Unity, Godot, C#, and modern native C++.

### 7. `SteamVR environment helpers and runtime hygiene tools`

- Main entries:
  `dashfix`, `SteamVR-Toggle`, `steamvr-undistort`, `SteamVR-VoidScene`,
  `steamvr-exconfig`
- Why it matters:
  these tools solve real VR pain points without being traditional overlays,
  which makes them especially useful for future `desktop companion` modules.

### 8. `Headsetless and no-HMD development workflows`

- Main entries:
  `SteamVRNoHeadset`, `ViveTrackerExample`, `VirtualSteamVRDriver`,
  `OpenXR-Simulator`
- Why it matters:
  this family turns scattered setup tricks into a real development and testing
  strategy for VR tooling without physical hardware.

### 9. `Mixed-VR controller and tracker bridges`

- Main entries:
  `Oculus_Touch_Steam_Link`, `SteamVR-OpenHMD`,
  `SlimeVR-OpenVR-Driver`
- Why it matters:
  this is one of the strongest architectural zones for turning foreign
  runtimes, services, or hardware stacks into usable SteamVR devices.

### 10. `Runtime adapters and graphics interop`

- Main entries:
  `OpenXR-Vk-D3D12`, `VirtualDesktop-OpenXR`, `OpenComposite`, `xrizer`
- Why it matters:
  these projects show how to bridge graphics and runtime expectations, not
  just how to switch runtimes or patch settings around them.

### 11. `Virtual display and repurposed output workflows`

- Main entries:
  `virtual_display`, `VRto3D`, `Virtual-Display-Driver`,
  `OpenDisplayXR-VDD`
- Why it matters:
  this family turns XR compositor output into creator, stereo-display, AR
  glasses, or simulated-hardware workflows.

### 12. `Validation and workflow micro-utilities`

- Main entries:
  `SteamVR-ActionsManifestValidator`, `Lighthouse-Scale-Fix`,
  `SteamVRAdaptiveBrightness`, `steamvr-exconfig`, `WFOVFix`
- Why it matters:
  these tiny tools solve real setup and workflow pain without needing to grow
  into full dashboard suites.
