# VR Utility Methods Catalog

- Date: `2026-04-19`
- Purpose: extract reusable implementation methods and product patterns from the
  tracked VR repositories, so `VR-apps-lab` can grow around proven approaches rather
  than only around named projects.

## How to use this file

Use this document when designing a new module or utility and ask:

1. which implementation method fits the problem?
2. which public repositories already demonstrate that method?
3. is the method better suited as:
   - overlay
   - API layer
   - background desktop utility
   - service/bridge
   - driver
   - creator tool

  `EyeTrackVR-OpenVR-Calibration-Overlay`,
  `OpenXR-Canonical-Pose-Tool`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  tracking helpers and setup tools.

## Method 13: Vendor enhancement layer

- What it is:
  augment the official vendor stack rather than replacing it.
- Good for:
  unlocking extra features, developer APIs, prediction improvements, haptics
  upgrades, optional mod layers.
- Why it matters:
  useful when the official stack exists but leaves value on the table.
- Strong references:
  `PSVR2Toolkit`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  future vendor-specific research branches.

## Method 14: Creator and research capture tool

- What it is:
  a utility focused on logging, capture, workflow, and content creation rather
  than only live overlay UX.
- Good for:
  session capture, pose logging, NLA recording, performance capture, workflow
  support.
- Why it matters:
  creator tools open a different product track than end-user overlays.
- Strong references:
  `clovr`, `tracking-toolkit`, `XRFrameTools`, `openvr-metrics`,
  `OpenKneeboard`, `OBS-OpenVR-Input-Plugin`, `Valve virtual_display`,
  `SuperScreenShotterVR`, `Periodic-Immersive-SteamVR-Screenshots`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  diagnostics and creator tools branch.

## Method 15: Passthrough and scoped reality layer experiment

- What it is:
  insert or compose limited real-world imagery or passthrough data into VR.
- Good for:
  external camera windows, projection experiments, scoped passthrough, reality
  tool prototypes.

  `LeapOVRPassthrough`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  experiments only unless hardware support is proven.

## Method 16: Runtime graphics adapter layer

- What it is:
  an API layer or runtime-side component that bridges incompatible graphics
  paths between the app and the active XR runtime.
- Good for:
  Vulkan-to-D3D runtime bridging, compatibility experiments, graphics
  interop, and runtime bring-up on awkward platform combinations.
- Why it matters:
  not every XR compatibility problem is solved by a runtime switcher; some
  need a true graphics adapter in the middle.
- Strong references:
  `OpenXR-Vk-D3D12`, `VirtualDesktop-OpenXR`, `OpenComposite`, `xrizer`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  advanced compatibility and runtime research.

## Method 17: Library plus sandbox learning harness

- What it is:
  a reusable runtime wrapper paired with a small sandbox executable that proves
  the wrapper in practice.
- Good for:
  onboarding, engine bring-up, extension experimentation, and keeping complex
  runtime setup reusable without hiding it completely.
- Why it matters:
  this is one of the best ways to turn raw XR bring-up knowledge into a
  reusable development asset.
- Strong references:
  `OpenXRProvider`, `OpenXR-SDK-Source` samples, `Simple-OpenVR-Driver-Tutorial`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  future sample apps and reusable experimental foundations.

## Method 18: Virtual display and remote presentation driver

- What it is:
  a driver or utility path that repurposes XR compositor output for another
  display, transport, or presentation flow rather than a standard HMD.
- Good for:
  wireless transport, creator capture, 3D displays, AR glasses, simulated
  hardware, and special-purpose stereo output workflows.
- Why it matters:
  this opens a whole class of VR-adjacent tools that are not classic overlays
  and not classic runtime switchers either.
- Strong references:
  `ValveSoftware/virtual_display`, `VRto3D`, `Virtual-Display-Driver`,
  `OpenDisplayXR-VDD`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  advanced workflow tooling and repurposed-output experiments.

## Method 19: Validation and config-patch micro-tool

- What it is:
  a very focused utility that validates one XR artifact or applies one safe
  configuration fix with backup and rollback behavior.
- Good for:
  manifest linting, SteamVR settings hygiene, one-off environment fixes,
  repair flows, and preflight checks.
- Why it matters:
  tiny helpers like these often solve real workflow pain faster than larger
  dashboard products.
- Strong references:
  `SteamVR-ActionsManifestValidator`, `Lighthouse-Scale-Fix`, `WFOVFix`,
  `steamvr-exconfig`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  desktop-side helpers and future doctor/preflight tools.

## Method 16: Custom device plumbing and driver prototyping

- What it is:
  integrate new device classes or experimental hardware into the VR stack using
  OpenVR drivers, pose-rewrite layers, or input-emulation sidecars.
- Good for:
  gloves, glasses, Arduino HMDs, cockpit control bridges, distributed tracking,
  legacy peripheral recovery, synthetic controllers, and simulator-linked pose
  manipulation.
- Why it matters:
  it is the main path for hardware experimentation in PCVR.
- Strong references:
  `opengloves-driver`, `GlassVr`, `OpenVR-ArduinoHMD`,
  `hotas-vr-controller`, `hobo_vr`, `Simple-OpenVR-Driver-Tutorial`,
  `SteamVR-OpenHMD`, `Oculus_Touch_Steam_Link`,
  `SlimeVR-OpenVR-Driver`, `VirtualSteamVRDriver`, `driver_hydra`,
  `OpenPSVR`, `OpenVR-driver-for-DIY`, `SegsVRControllerDriverSample`,
  `Barebone`, `Joy2OpenVR`, `SteamVR-Glove`,
  `OpenVR-MotionCompensation`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  advanced research and hardware bridge branch.

## Method 17: Web-rendered overlay surface

- What it is:
  render a web UI or browser surface into a VR overlay and treat the browser as
  the primary UI layer.
- Good for:
  rich dashboards, remote-control panels, streamer tools, HTML/CSS-based
  interfaces, plugin-friendly control surfaces.
- Why it matters:
  this can dramatically speed up UI iteration and lowers the cost of complex
  panel design.
- Strong references:
  `SteamVR-Webkit`, `overlay_experiments`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  advanced dashboards and external-control surfaces.

## Method 18: SteamVR environment helper and runtime hygiene tool

- What it is:
  a narrow helper that improves the way SteamVR behaves around startup,
  dashboard input, compositor state, or overlay-heavy workflows.
- Good for:
  toggles, dashboard fixes, distortion tuning, headroom helpers, tray tools,
  pre-launch configuration.
- Why it matters:
  many valuable VR utilities are not overlays at all - they remove runtime
  friction around SteamVR.
- Strong references:
  `steamvr-exconfig`, `dashfix`, `SteamVR-Toggle`, `steamvr-undistort`,
  `SteamVR-VoidScene`, `OculusKiller`, `SteamVRNoHeadset`,
  `ViveTrackerExample`, `WFOVFix`, `SteamVRLinuxFixes`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  desktop-side support tools and maintenance helpers.

## Method 19: Headless overlay host

- What it is:
  an app whose real job is to keep one or more VR overlays alive while the
  desktop window stays hidden, minimized, or visually irrelevant.
- Good for:
  background overlay suites, tray-driven utilities, Unity-based dashboards
  without desktop clutter, status indicators that should feel always-on.
- Why it matters:
  many practical VR tools are valuable precisely because they do not behave
  like normal foreground desktop apps.
- Strong references:
  `HeadlessOverlayToolkit`, `SteaMeeter`, `VRCMicOverlay`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  always-on utility hosts and background helper surfaces.

## Method 20: Runtime inventory and capability matrix

- What it is:
  a structured catalog of runtime, middleware, or client capabilities that can
  be parsed, compared, and rendered into human-readable reports or diagnostics.
- Good for:
  capability dashboards, compatibility reports, runtime-health tools, extension
  support matrices, and environment triage.
- Why it matters:
  prose notes alone do not scale once the repository starts comparing many XR
  runtimes, layers, and clients.
- Strong references:
  `OpenXR-Inventory`, `xr-picker`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  capability intelligence behind `OpenXR Doctor` and related research tools.

## Method 21: Vendor shell replacement and runtime auto-redirect

- What it is:
  replace, intercept, or supervise a vendor launcher or dashboard process so it
  redirects into a different VR runtime or workflow.
- Good for:
  Oculus-to-SteamVR flows, startup cleanup, desktop runtime redirection, and
  narrow environment helpers.
- Why it matters:
  not every valuable VR tool lives inside the headset; some remove friction by
  fixing runtime launch behavior.
- Strong references:
  `OculusKiller`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  advanced environment-helper and compatibility research.

## Method 22: Headsetless and null-driver development workflow

- What it is:
  run SteamVR or OpenXR tooling without a real headset through null drivers,
  virtual HMDs, or simulator runtimes.
- Good for:
  tool development, test harnesses, tracker-only workflows, manual QA without
  full hardware, and reproducible dev setups.
- Why it matters:
  this method lowers the barrier to developing VR utilities and diagnostics.
- Strong references:
  `SteamVRNoHeadset`, `ViveTrackerExample`, `VirtualSteamVRDriver`,
  `OpenXR-Simulator`, `unity-openvr-tracking`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  developer tooling, research harnesses, and workflow docs.

## Method 23: OpenVR mirror-surface capture bridge

- What it is:
  acquire SteamVR/OpenVR mirror textures and route them into an external
  desktop application or capture pipeline.
- Good for:
  OBS plugins, creator tools, debugging, stream production, and research
  recording.
- Why it matters:
  capture bridges are a distinct class of VR utility that connects runtime
  output to non-VR tools.
- Strong references:
  `OBS-OpenVR-Input-Plugin`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  creator workflows and runtime-inspection side tools.

## Method 24: Mixed tracking and controller bridge

- What it is:
  convert foreign runtime devices, external services, or non-native hardware
  into SteamVR/OpenVR controllers, trackers, sensors, or HMD-like devices.
- Good for:
  MixedVR setups, controller reuse, tracker bridging, external pose services,
  and hardware interoperability experiments.
- Why it matters:
  this is one of the richest paths for turning external ecosystems into usable
  VR devices.
- Strong references:
  `Oculus_Touch_Steam_Link`, `SteamVR-OpenHMD`,
  `SlimeVR-OpenVR-Driver`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  tracker-bridge and driver-plumbing research.

## Method 25: Vision-tracking sidecar with switchable backend

- What it is:
  a camera or CV pipeline estimates pose or gestures in a sidecar process and
  can target more than one output backend such as a SteamVR driver, OSC, or a
  lightweight bridge protocol.
- Good for:
  low-cost body tracking, webcam hand tracking, Quest-friendly calibration
  flows, and experiments where the tracking frontend should stay decoupled from
  the runtime output path.
- Why it matters:
  this method turns one fragile tracker experiment into a reusable pipeline with
  multiple delivery targets.
- Strong references:
  `Mediapipe-VR-Fullbody-Tracking`, `HandCameraDriver`,
  `NVIDIA-BodyTracking`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  experimental tracking bridges and calibration-first prototypes.

## Method 26: Plugin-based tracking host with service endpoints

- What it is:
  a host application defines contracts for `device plugins` and `service
  endpoints`, then centralizes calibration, lifecycle, and settings UX while
  letting diverse sensors and output targets plug into the same shell.
- Good for:
  alternative tracking ecosystems, modular device support, mixed output targets,
  and long-lived desktop hosts that should survive beyond one sensor class.
- Why it matters:
  this is the cleanest architecture in the repo so far for turning a messy
  tracking ecosystem into a coherent product platform.
- Strong references:
  `KinectToVR/Amethyst`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  long-term tracking lab architecture and reusable bridge hosts.

## Method 27: Headsetless camera runtime

- What it is:
  a custom OpenXR runtime pretends to be real XR hardware while a separate
  tracker process feeds it camera-derived head and hand input.
- Good for:
  no-HMD QA, education, accessibility experiments, runtime debugging, and
  fake-hardware bring-up without dedicated devices.
- Why it matters:
  this is qualitatively different from a null driver or simulator because it
  owns actual runtime registration, swapchain flow, and runtime-side input.
- Strong references:
  `aethervr`, `OpenXR-Simulator`, `VirtualSteamVRDriver`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  research harnesses, headsetless workflow docs, and advanced runtime
  experimentation.

## Method 28: Overlay toolkit and prefab scaffolding

- What it is:
  a lightweight helper layer that wraps overlay creation, render-texture
  submission, and pointer/input translation into reusable scene components or
  plugin nodes rather than a full end-user utility product.
- Good for:
  rapid overlay prototyping, Unity or Godot experiments, internal labs, and
  reusable host scaffolding for future utility suites.
- Why it matters:
  this is the shortest path between `raw overlay API` and `finished overlay
  product`, and it keeps early UX experiments from turning into throwaway code.
- Strong references:
  `OVRLay`, `OVROverlayManager`, `openvr_widgets`, `ovr-utils-dashboard`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  future overlay host abstractions and reusable prototype scaffolds.

## Method 29: Driver ingress endpoint for external tracker feeds

- What it is:
  an OpenVR driver exposes a transport endpoint such as a `named pipe` or local
  `WebSocket` so external programs can spawn, update, or query trackers without
  embedding the whole tracking stack inside the driver.
- Good for:
  CV sidecars, locomotion helpers, browser-based prototypes, mixed-language
  experiments, and custom sensors that should stay out-of-process.
- Why it matters:
  this is one of the cleanest ways to decouple `tracking producer` from
  `SteamVR driver lifecycle`.
- Strong references:
  `Simple-OpenVR-Bridge-Driver`, `OpenVR-Tracker-Websocket-Driver`,
  `3NekoSystem/OpenVR-Tracker-Websocket-Driver`,
  `SegsVRControllerDriverSample`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  tracker bridge services and experimental sensor ingress.

## Method 30: Engine-side tracked-device adapter with SteamVR role reuse

- What it is:
  a game-engine package reads OpenVR device poses directly and reuses
  SteamVR tracker-role bindings or serial mappings inside scene objects,
  without needing the full end-user SteamVR app stack.
- Good for:
  Unity tools, no-HMD tracker workflows, previs, device visualization, and
  internal lab apps.
- Why it matters:
  it turns SteamVR device state into a reusable engine subsystem instead of a
  one-off integration script.
- Strong references:
  `unity-openvr-tracking`, `SteamVRTrackerUtility`, `ViveTrackerExample`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  engine plugins, no-HMD development workflows, and internal research tools.

## Method 31: Direct tracker and controller state export to OSC consumers

- What it is:
  a desktop sidecar turns SteamVR state, tracker roles, controller actions, or
  vendor-specific body data into OSC messages for VRChat or other consumers,
  without requiring a new SteamVR driver.
- Good for:
  avatar parameters, Quest-friendly workflows, remote control surfaces, and
  thin consumer-facing bridges.
- Why it matters:
  sometimes the shortest and most honest utility path is
  `SteamVR or vendor SDK -> OSC consumer`, not `new driver`.
- Strong references:
  `OpenVR-OSC`, `VRCThumbParamsOSC`, `axis-vrc-osc-bridge`,
  `OpenVR2OSC`, `SteamVR_To_OSC`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  direct consumer bridges, avatar utilities, and quick automation prototypes.

## Method 32: Existing UI stack to overlay texture bridge

- What it is:
  an overlay host reuses a mature UI stack such as `WinForms`, `WPF`, `CEF`,
  or `ImGui`, rasterizes it into a texture, and translates overlay input back
  into that UI runtime.
- Good for:
  dashboard apps, browser-backed utilities, desktop-parity tools, and
  productivity overlays that should not be rebuilt from scratch as VR-only UI.
- Why it matters:
  this is one of the shortest paths from `desktop-grade UI` to
  `usable VR overlay`, and it keeps the overlay layer focused on transport,
  lifecycle, and input translation.
- Strong references:
  `SteamVR_HUDCenter`, `SteamVR-WebApps`, `h-view`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  future overlay shells, control surfaces, and diagnostics tools with desktop
  parity.

## Method 33: Overlay patch micro-tool over an existing runtime surface

- What it is:
  a tiny helper finds an overlay the runtime already owns and modifies its
  bounds, placement, or behavior instead of rendering a new overlay host.
- Good for:
  desktop-overlay crop tools, workflow patches, corrective helpers, and
  extremely narrow utilities that should stay small.
- Why it matters:
  sometimes the right VR utility is not `new overlay app`; it is
  `surgical patch over the overlay users already have`.
- Strong references:
  `SteamVR-PrimaryDesktopOverlay`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  small corrective helpers and runtime-comfort micro-tools.

## Method 34: Scene-based overlay scaffold with tracked attachments

- What it is:
  a Unity or engine scene acts as the overlay body, while tracked-device
  helpers, sensors, or simple interactions drive scene content inside that
  overlay space.
- Good for:
  embodied HUDs, tracker-mounted scenes, experimental utility shells,
  sensor-enhanced overlays, and rapid spatial UI experiments.
- Why it matters:
  not every useful overlay should start as a flat desktop panel; some utility
  concepts are easier to prototype as a small scene with tracked attachments.
- Strong references:
  `VRSceneOverlay`, `VROverlay`, `OVROverlayManager`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  experimental overlay concepts, scene-overlay labs, and tracker-aware utility
  prototypes.

## Method 35: State-transition device watcher with multi-channel alerts

- What it is:
  a background helper watches device properties over time and reacts when a
  state changes in a meaningful way, instead of only displaying a raw snapshot.
- Good for:
  charging warnings, device-health alerts, reconnect hints, and narrow
  background utilities with desktop or in-headset notifications.
- Why it matters:
  many practical VR device tools become useful only when they detect
  `something changed`, not when they merely print current numbers.
- Strong references:
  `openvr-battery-monitoring`, `vive-wireless-info-overlay`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  device-health watchers and narrow status helpers.

## Method 36: Pose inventory snapshot exporter

- What it is:
  a utility captures the current runtime pose inventory and turns it into a
  reusable artifact such as an `FBX`, scene snapshot, or creator-side data
  export.
- Good for:
  avatar fitting, previs, creator tools, diagnostics, room-state capture, and
  device-layout inspection.
- Why it matters:
  it turns volatile live runtime state into something the user can reuse,
  compare, or import elsewhere.
- Strong references:
  `openvr-device-positions`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  creator utilities, diagnostics, and export helpers.

## Method 37: Remote overlay session via API layer plus out-of-process client

- What it is:
  an OpenXR API layer owns the interception and session injection, while a
  separate process supplies the overlay content and drives the remote session.
- Good for:
  cross-app overlays, experimental runtime-level composition, and research into
  layer-host coordination.
- Why it matters:
  this is fundamentally different from a companion overlay app because the
  overlay exists inside an unaware host application's runtime path.
- Strong references:
  `OpenXR-OverlayLayer`, `OpenXR-OverlayLayer-1`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  advanced OpenXR layer research and future runtime-level utility experiments.

## Method 38: Registry-plus-probe runtime switcher

- What it is:
  a runtime manager reads the official registry state or manifest state, then
  supplements it with well-known path probes and optional runtime-specific
  discovery helpers.
- Good for:
  OpenXR runtime switching, manifest inspection, setup diagnostics, and
  developer-facing runtime hygiene tools.
- Why it matters:
  real user setups are often messier than the ideal registry state, so a useful
  switcher needs both official discovery and pragmatic probing.
- Strong references:
  `OpenXR-Runtime-Manager`, `xr-picker`, `openxr-explorer`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  `OpenXR Doctor` and runtime management helpers.

## Method 39: Protocol-adapter OpenXR layer for foreign sensor data

- What it is:
  an OpenXR API layer ingests data from an external service or protocol and
  presents it as a runtime-facing extension, action state, or tracked signal.
- Good for:
  eye tracking, controller fixes, vendor-specific bridges, and runtime-level
  experiments where a new SteamVR driver would be the wrong boundary.
- Why it matters:
  sometimes the cleanest adaptation surface is `protocol -> OpenXR layer`, not
  `protocol -> new driver`.
- Strong references:
  `etvr-openxr-layer`, `clearxr-layer`, `OpenXR-Eye-Trackers`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  advanced runtime adaptation and experimental extension bridges.

## Method 40: Multi-transport custom-device provider with sidecar control surface

- What it is:
  an OpenVR driver owns one or more tracked devices, but discovery,
  configuration, calibration, or user-facing controls live in a separate helper
  process, overlay, or desktop app.
- Good for:
  DIY hardware, gloves, nonstandard controllers, repurposed glasses, and
  complex setups that need multiple transport backends.
- Why it matters:
  it keeps the SteamVR driver small enough to stay stable while moving the
  messy operational logic into a more flexible sidecar.
- Strong references:
  `opengloves-driver`, `GlassVr`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  future custom-device platforms and bridge-heavy hardware tools.

## Method 41: Vendor-driver wrapper with proxy hooks and local IPC

- What it is:
  a shim loads the original vendor driver, proxies or hooks selected internal
  surfaces, and exposes extra capabilities through a local IPC or developer API
  layer.
- Good for:
  optional vendor feature unlocks, developer APIs, haptics upgrades, eye
  tracking access, and non-destructive enhancement layers.
- Why it matters:
  this is the cleanest path when replacing the vendor stack would be too risky
  or too expensive.
- Strong references:
  `PSVR2Toolkit`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  vendor-enhancement research and carefully-scoped official-stack extensions.

## Method 42: Runtime-aware DXGI proxy performance mod

- What it is:
  a drop-in `dxgi.dll` or graphics-proxy utility intercepts the rendering path,
  forwards to the original graphics library when needed, and applies scaling,
  foveation, or image-treatment logic through one runtime-aware config surface.
- Good for:
  VR performance helpers, render-scale utilities, compatibility-focused fork
  lines, and graphics-path experiments that should stay outside the main app.
- Why it matters:
  this is a distinct construction method from overlays, API layers, or drivers;
  the product boundary is the proxy DLL itself.
- Strong references:
  `vrperfkit`, `VRPerfKit_RSF`, `OpenVRPerfKit`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  graphics-path utilities and rendering-side experimentation.

## Method 43: Single-pass VR sweet-spot shader bundle

- What it is:
  a compact VR-focused shader pack groups several useful image treatments into
  one coherent effect surface instead of exposing a loose pile of unrelated
  post-process scripts.
- Good for:
  sharpening, color tuning, center-mask shaping, lightweight image cleanup, and
  user-facing visual-comfort adjustments.
- Why it matters:
  sometimes the best donor is not a runtime or driver architecture, but a well
  packaged `one strong visual toolkit` that matches VR needs.
- Strong references:
  `reshade-vrtoolkit`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  rendering experiments and compact visual-adjustment modules.

## Method 44: Plugin-host tracking platform with device and service endpoints

- What it is:
  a desktop host provides calibration, settings, lifecycle, and UX, while
  swappable plugins represent tracking devices and output-side service
  endpoints.
- Good for:
  modular tracking labs, alternative body-tracking platforms, mixed hardware
  stacks, and future systems that need both input-device and output-service
  variation.
- Why it matters:
  it scales much better than a monolithic tracking app when the family of
  devices and outputs keeps growing.
- Strong references:
  `Amethyst`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  future tracking-host experiments and research-oriented utility shells.

## Method 45: Switchable CV tracking backend with web control surface

- What it is:
  one computer-vision tracking pipeline can target different downstream outputs
  such as a SteamVR driver or an OSC consumer, while settings and calibration
  are exposed through a lightweight web UI.
- Good for:
  Quest-friendly workflows, camera-based prototypes, thin companion tools, and
  backend experiments where a heavy desktop host would be overkill.
- Why it matters:
  it keeps `pose estimation`, `output choice`, and `control surface` separated,
  which makes camera-tracking utilities more reusable.
- Strong references:
  `Mediapipe-VR-Fullbody-Tracking`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  camera-side utility prototypes and lightweight calibration/control surfaces.

## Method 46: External driver protocol with language bindings and poser processes

- What it is:
  a SteamVR driver exposes an explicit contract so external processes, scripts,
  or language bindings can act as device posers instead of hiding all ingress
  inside one private daemon.
- Good for:
  experimentation, scripting, research harnesses, Linux-friendly tooling, and
  custom hardware labs where the driver should stay small and stable.
- Why it matters:
  it turns the driver into a reusable platform boundary instead of a sealed
  implementation detail.
- Strong references:
  `hobo_vr`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  future bridge experiments, lab tooling, and scriptable device-ingress paths.

## Method 47: Firmware-plus-driver co-designed custom device ecosystem

- What it is:
  a hardware repo and a runtime repo are designed as one system, with transport,
  encoding, haptics, and driver expectations aligned across both sides.
- Good for:
  gloves, wearable controllers, DIY hardware families, and projects where one
  driver repo alone hides too much of the real architecture.
- Why it matters:
  many of the strongest custom-device lessons live at the ecosystem level, not
  just in the final SteamVR bridge.
- Strong references:
  `opengloves-driver`, `lucidgloves`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  future custom-device platforms and donor analysis for hardware ecosystems.

## Method 48: Tracked-controller relocation via config offsets and click interception

- What it is:
  a bridge keeps SteamVR tracking but reshapes the effective controller pose and
  input semantics around a real physical object through offsets, hooks, and
  supplemental click devices.
- Good for:
  cockpit hardware, tool handles, props, attachment-based experiments, and
  narrow but high-value physical workflow utilities.
- Why it matters:
  this is a useful product pattern whenever the user's real hardware should
  define the interaction model more than the stock VR controller shape.
- Strong references:
  `hotas-vr-controller`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  physical workflow tools, attachment experiments, and niche controller
  adaptation utilities.

## Method 49: Local speech-recognition sidecar feeding a native VR overlay

- What it is:
  speech recognition runs in a local service or sidecar, while a separate VR
  surface subscribes to caption messages and owns the visual presentation.
- Good for:
  accessibility captions, language tools, communication helpers, and
  experimental assistive overlays.
- Why it matters:
  it keeps the heavy speech stack separate from the render loop and lets the
  overlay stay simple.
- Strong references:
  `live-captions-vr`, `OpenVRCaptions`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  accessibility tools and caption-oriented overlay experiments.

## Method 50: Multi-output local transcription utility with VR overlay as one consumer

- What it is:
  a local speech host performs transcription once, then routes the result to
  one or more consumers such as a SteamVR overlay, OSC client, browser page, or
  host-app integration.
- Good for:
  speech-to-text utilities, social VR helpers, accessibility hubs, and
  lightweight automation surfaces.
- Why it matters:
  the reusable core is the transcription service, not any one target surface.
- Strong references:
  `VRCTextboxSTT`, `UniversalVR-CC`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  future local STT hosts and mixed-output assistive tools.

## Method 51: Null-driver config swapper with backup-safe mode toggling

- What it is:
  a tiny utility snapshots or preserves relevant settings, flips SteamVR into a
  null-driver or no-HMD configuration, and can restore the previous state.
- Good for:
  headsetless QA, no-HMD bring-up, graphics-path testing, and low-friction dev
  workflows.
- Why it matters:
  turning a fragile manual edit into a repeatable mode switch has outsized
  value for development ergonomics.
- Strong references:
  `SteamVRNullFlipper`, `SteamVRNoHeadset`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  headsetless workflow helpers and SteamVR environment micro-tools.

## Method 52: Automation-friendly simulator runtime with shared core plus GUI or API controllers

- What it is:
  a simulator runtime exposes one core control layer, while desktop GUI tools,
  scripts, or automation clients all talk to the same underlying simulator API.
- Good for:
  XR QA sandboxes, scripted runtime testing, fake-hardware bring-up, and
  developer tooling.
- Why it matters:
  it scales much better than one-off debug UIs because the simulator becomes a
  reusable platform boundary.
- Strong references:
  `OpenXR-Simulator`, `ox-sim-driver`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  future scriptable QA runtimes and runtime-bring-up tools.

## Method 53: SDK-first device bridge with a separated dedicated driver repo

- What it is:
  a device family exposes transport and capability logic through a public SDK or
  API layer first, while the runtime-specific driver lives as a thinner
  downstream bridge.
- Good for:
  glasses bridges, custom displays, hardware SDKs, and device families that may
  target several runtime integrations over time.
- Why it matters:
  it keeps hardware-specific logic from being trapped inside one runtime plugin.
- Strong references:
  `RayNeo-Air-3S-Pro-OpenVR`, `RayNeo-Air-3S-Pro-OpenVR-Driver`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  custom-device platforms and repurposed-output research.

## Method 54: Vendor enhancement ecosystem built around local IPC and downstream consumers

- What it is:
  a vendor-wrapper layer exposes extra capabilities through a local IPC or
  developer API, and smaller downstream repos consume that contract for
  app-specific features or utilities.
- Good for:
  eye-tracking access, haptics extensions, trigger tuning, and non-destructive
  augmentation of official stacks.
- Why it matters:
  the ecosystem value is in the contract and the downstream consumers, not only
  in the main wrapper itself.
- Strong references:
  `PSVR2Toolkit`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  vendor-enhancement research and local developer-API experiments.

## Method 55: Consumer-specific module over vendor IPC

- What it is:
  a small adapter consumes a broader vendor IPC contract and maps only the
  target-app semantics that matter for one host ecosystem.
- Good for:
  engine mods, avatar tracking adapters, and host-specific feature bridges.
- Why it matters:
  it keeps the vendor integration generic while allowing small downstream
  specializations to move quickly.
- Strong references:
  `PSVR2Toolkit.VRCFT`, `ResonitePSVR2`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  downstream module design and ecosystem-aware utility contracts.

## Method 56: Config micro-tool over vendor IPC

- What it is:
  a narrow desktop utility talks to a vendor IPC contract to expose one
  high-value configuration flow with little extra product baggage.
- Good for:
  trigger tuning, haptics presets, calibration helpers, and other small control
  surfaces.
- Why it matters:
  many of the best vendor utilities should stay small and focused rather than
  being folded into one giant shell.
- Strong references:
  `PSVR2ToolkitTriggerConfig`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  focused companion apps and single-purpose tuning tools.

## Method 57: Driver-side pose rewrite with shared library and overlay configuration

- What it is:
  a driver hooks or intercepts pose flow, applies correction logic, and exposes
  its configuration through a shared library plus an overlay or dashboard
  control surface.
- Good for:
  motion compensation, pose manipulation, experimental alignment tools, and
  runtime-side correction research.
- Why it matters:
  it combines low-level correction power with a user-facing configuration path.
- Strong references:
  `OpenVR-MotionCompensation`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  advanced alignment utilities and pose-rewrite experiments.

## Method 58: Continuous calibration overlay layered on top of a one-shot alignment baseline

- What it is:
  a calibration tool keeps the standard point-sequence and initial solve, but
  then adds metrics, persistence, and live correction logic for ongoing
  alignment.
- Good for:
  mixed-tracking workflows, long sessions, unstable spaces, and evolving sensor
  alignment.
- Why it matters:
  the real product value is often the continuous correction layer, not only the
  initial calibration solve.
- Strong references:
  `OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator2`, `OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  future calibration helpers and alignment UX research.

## Method 59: Pose capture to reconstruction pipeline for spatial alignment experiments

- What it is:
  a runtime capture tool records images and tracked poses, then feeds them into
  an offline reconstruction or mapping pipeline to produce alignment-friendly
  spatial artifacts.
- Good for:
  room mapping, scene reconstruction, spatial diagnostics, and environment
  alignment experiments.
- Why it matters:
  some alignment problems are solved better by better capture artifacts than by
  yet another live overlay.
- Strong references:
  `openvr-room-mapping`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  spatial diagnostics, room-scan experiments, and calibration-adjacent capture
  tools.

## Method 60: Tracked physical keyboard with hand-proximity reveal and MR boundary visualization

- What it is:
  a VR typing surface is anchored to a runtime-tracked real keyboard, while the
  app controls visibility, boundary rendering, and hand-near reveal behavior.
- Good for:
  mixed-reality desk setups, setup and login flows, configuration panels, and
  utilities that benefit from real hardware typing instead of synthetic keys.
- Why it matters:
  when real hardware exists, the best UX is often not another floating keyboard
  but a better `tracked-hardware wrapper`.
- Strong references:
  `Unity-TrackedKeyboard`, `XR-Keyboard`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  desk-aware setup tools, MR configuration surfaces, and tracked-input
  experiments.

## Method 61: Non-native spatial keyboard with semantic layouts, validation surfaces, and event callbacks

- What it is:
  a reusable keyboard component exposes layout modes, validation or placeholder
  surfaces, and host-facing events instead of forcing each app to own its own
  text-entry logic.
- Good for:
  search fields, setup wizards, quick text entry, naming flows, and any tool
  that needs small but structured user input inside XR.
- Why it matters:
  the reusable unit is not the key art but the `keyboard lifecycle contract`.
- Strong references:
  `MRTK-Keyboard`, `VRKeys`, `XR-Interaction-Toolkit-Examples`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  utility-side text entry, setup UI, and keyboard components that can be shared
  across future tools.

## Method 62: Palm-up launcher that opens richer world-space panels at a separate popup anchor

- What it is:
  a small launcher appears on or near the hand, but the heavier content opens
  at a detached popup anchor that is easier to read and interact with.
- Good for:
  quick actions, tool palettes, small dashboards, wrist or palm launchers, and
  utilities that need fast access without making the hand itself too crowded.
- Why it matters:
  it separates `quick reveal` from `serious interaction`, which usually
  produces a calmer VR menu UX.
- Strong references:
  `XRHandMenuSample`, `mr-example-meta-openxr`, `MixedRealityToolkit-Unity`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  hand-first utility shells, launcher patterns, and compact control surfaces.

## Method 63: Menu-archetype generator with radial, ring, and default templates plus editor-side modifiers

- What it is:
  menu behavior is packaged as reusable archetypes and creator tools, while a
  separate modifier layer tunes style or behavior after generation.
- Good for:
  Unity-heavy toolkits, reusable UI kits, experiments that compare radial and
  ring menus, and teams that want faster iteration on menu shape.
- Why it matters:
  it turns menus from one-off scene objects into reusable authoring assets.
- Strong references:
  `VRMenuDesigner`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  internal XR UI kits, reusable menu scaffolds, and faster prototyping of menu
  variants.

## Method 64: Physicalized radial selection that materializes actual interactables into the hand

- What it is:
  a radial menu acts less like a command list and more like a temporary picker
  that resolves into a real tool or interactable already attached to the user's
  hand.
- Good for:
  tool selection, inventory wheels, controller-attached object pickers, and
  workflows where the selected item should become immediately grabbable.
- Why it matters:
  it blurs the boundary between `menu` and `interaction`, which is often more
  natural in VR than clicking a detached UI command.
- Strong references:
  `UnityXR-Physicalized-Radial-Menu`, `RadialMenuVR`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  tool-palette experiments, radial pickers, and embodied command surfaces.

## Method 65: XR UI interaction stack that extends EventSystem with ray, poke, and hand input

- What it is:
  a framework adapts the normal UI event system to XR by adding custom input
  modules, raycasters, hand or poke interaction, and activation heuristics.
- Good for:
  world-space menus, panels, keyboards, toolkit-scale UI, and utilities that
  want to reuse ordinary UI controls in XR.
- Why it matters:
  many future VR tools should extend a UI substrate instead of rebuilding every
  control as a special case.
- Strong references:
  `ViveInputUtility-Unity`, `XR-Interaction-Toolkit-Examples`,
  `MixedRealityToolkit-Unity`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  shared UI infrastructure, framework selection, and future toolkit-oriented
  prototypes.

## Method 66: Teleoperation workspace with palm-menu control hub and live connection-state surfaces

- What it is:
  a VR workspace exposes remote-system control through palm menus, side panels,
  and live status indicators rather than one flat generic dashboard.
- Good for:
  teleoperation, operations dashboards, remote procedure control, and control
  rooms for external services or devices.
- Why it matters:
  workflow structure and state visibility often matter more than raw command
  density in embodied control tools.
- Strong references:
  `unity_ros_teleoperation`, `ReachyTeleoperation`, `ros_reality`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  control-room research, operator dashboards, and command-oriented utility
  surfaces.

## Method 67: Thin VR control frontend that streams controller state to an external robot or service process

- What it is:
  the VR app stays intentionally thin and exports controller pose or button
  state to another process that owns the real business logic.
- Good for:
  robotics frontends, remote-system control, simulator input, and fast XR
  command bridges.
- Why it matters:
  it keeps the VR layer simple and reusable when the real product logic lives
  elsewhere.
- Strong references:
  `UR10_Teleop`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  thin bridge apps, embodied input exporters, and sidecar-controlled workflow
  tools.

## Method 68: Browser-automation sidecar that turns a social service into a VR overlay surface

- What it is:
  a desktop automation layer extracts presence or voice state from a social
  service, while a separate OpenVR app renders that state as a configurable VR
  overlay.
- Good for:
  voice presence, chat status, social participation indicators, and
  communication overlays when no direct public API gives the exact UI surface
  the product needs.
- Why it matters:
  it separates `service scraping or automation` from `VR presentation`, which
  keeps the overlay side simpler and more reusable.
- Strong references:
  `discord-vr`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  social overlays, companion presence surfaces, and communication-sidecar
  experiments.

## Method 69: Native chat companion with dual social-service and OSC outputs

- What it is:
  a small desktop-native app owns chat composition and history, while the same
  surface can send messages to both a social platform and a local `OSC`
  consumer.
- Good for:
  VRChat-adjacent chat helpers, streaming companions, desktop-side message
  entry, and bridge tools where XR-facing consumers should not own service auth.
- Why it matters:
  it turns a simple chat utility into a reusable `dual-output communication
  surface`.
- Strong references:
  `VRCattoChatto`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  desktop-side VR companions, OSC chat bridges, and social utility micro-tools.

## Method 70: Service-first communication utility where the overlay is only one consumer

- What it is:
  the core product is a background service or engine, while the VR overlay or
  VR-specific UI is only one optional consumer of the real service outputs.
- Good for:
  proximity systems, social-safety tools, local communication helpers, and
  products where VR should have controls or visibility but not necessarily own
  the whole architecture.
- Why it matters:
  many useful VR utilities should be `service-first`, with overlay UX treated
  as a thin control layer rather than the whole app.
- Strong references:
  `vrchat-proximity-app`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  hybrid utilities, overlay-optional helpers, and VR companions that sit on
  top of a broader desktop-side engine.

## Method 71: Local speech platform with OSC and websocket multi-consumer outputs

- What it is:
  a speech, translation, or assistant host keeps capture and inference local,
  then fans results out through `OSC`, `WebSocket`, files, playback, or plugin
  channels for many downstream consumers.
- Good for:
  captions, avatar chat helpers, translation overlays, accessibility tools, and
  any VR workflow that should consume speech without owning the inference stack.
- Why it matters:
  it treats VR as one consumer of a broader local speech platform instead of
  rebuilding a speech pipeline inside each overlay utility.
- Strong references:
  `whispering`, `VRCTextboxSTT`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  speech-sidecar research, accessibility tools, and communication hosts with
  multiple VR or non-VR outputs.

## Method 72: Cleanly layered alternative OpenXR runtime for special displays

- What it is:
  an OpenXR runtime is decomposed into strict layers for state tracking,
  compositing, device drivers, and display processors, with explicit rules
  about what each layer must not own.
- Good for:
  spatial displays, 3D monitors, glasses, and future runtime experiments where
  ordinary headset assumptions do not apply.
- Why it matters:
  explicit runtime decomposition makes alternative platform work easier to
  reason about and reuse.
- Strong references:
  `displayxr-runtime`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  runtime-architecture research, special-display experiments, and future
  nontraditional OpenXR platform work.

## Method 73: Embedded or platform-native OpenXR runtime framework

- What it is:
  the OpenXR runtime is packaged as a framework or library inside a
  platform-native app rather than as a normal desktop runtime registered for
  general system-wide use.
- Good for:
  mobile platforms, Apple-platform XR experiments, tightly integrated vendor
  apps, and runtimes where the host app should own lifecycle and services.
- Why it matters:
  not every useful runtime path should look like a Windows desktop runtime
  installation.
- Strong references:
  `OpenXRKit`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  platform-native runtime research, embedded-framework experiments, and
  alternative XR host architectures.

## Method 74: Runtime-server split with local IPC for experimental OpenXR platforms

- What it is:
  the runtime surface and the controlling host application are separated by a
  local IPC boundary, so the runtime primitives can stay lean while the host
  owns lifecycle, bridges, or UI integration.
- Good for:
  proof-of-concept runtimes, nontraditional platforms, WebXR bridges, and
  experimental runtime ownership models.
- Why it matters:
  it provides a cleaner way to explore runtime behavior on platforms where one
  monolithic process is awkward or unnatural.
- Strong references:
  `FruitXR`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  platform experiments, runtime-service research, and bridge-heavy runtime
  prototypes.

## Method 75: CAD-to-SteamVR tracking JSON generation from physical design geometry

- What it is:
  a CAD or authoring environment produces SteamVR tracking definitions by
  converting construction axes, points, or other design-time geometry into the
  sensor map that the runtime expects.
- Good for:
  custom tracked-device design, Lighthouse hardware experiments, and repeatable
  authoring of tracker geometry without hand-editing large JSON payloads.
- Why it matters:
  it moves a complex device-definition step into a tool where the physical
  design already exists.
- Strong references:
  `Fusion360_SteamVR_Json`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  custom-device research, tracked-hardware authoring workflows, and future
  design-tool utilities.

## Method 76: Derived virtual tracker from existing tracked nodes with role-specific device registration

- What it is:
  a driver derives a missing tracked role from other tracked nodes, then
  registers the result as if it were a real device with believable metadata and
  role hints.
- Good for:
  synthetic waist or torso trackers, missing-role reconstruction, lightweight
  augmentation of partial body-tracking setups, and role-specific helpers.
- Why it matters:
  it treats synthetic tracking as `runtime-visible device generation`, not only
  as app-local math.
- Strong references:
  `augmented-hip`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  derived-tracker helpers, role reconstruction tools, and synthetic device
  experiments.

## Method 77: DIY tracker ecosystem split across firmware, desktop control app, and driver

- What it is:
  a custom tracking system is intentionally split into hardware firmware, a
  desktop configurator or calibration app, and a runtime driver that registers
  the tracked devices.
- Good for:
  IMU trackers, WiFi-connected custom devices, maker hardware projects, and
  future custom sensor ecosystems.
- Why it matters:
  it keeps hardware bring-up, user configuration, and runtime registration from
  collapsing into one hard-to-maintain component.
- Strong references:
  `IMU-VR-Full-Body-Tracker`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  DIY hardware research, driver-plus-companion patterns, and custom-device
  ecosystem design.

## Method 78: Overlay-assisted calibration over modular expressive-tracking capture sources

- What it is:
  an expressive-tracking platform keeps capture backends modular, then runs
  calibration or trainer flows through a dedicated overlay surface or overlay
  program.
- Good for:
  face tracking, eye tracking, trainer UX, multi-camera or multi-source
  platforms, and any expressive-input tool that needs a guided user flow.
- Why it matters:
  calibration becomes a reusable `service plus overlay` boundary rather than an
  ad hoc scene or one-off window.
- Strong references:
  `Baballonia`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  expressive-tracking platforms, overlay-guided trainer tools, and reusable
  calibration-host infrastructure.

## Method 79: Cross-provider hand-input remapping into a common interaction model

- What it is:
  a compatibility layer swaps or adapts multiple hand or controller providers
  into one shared interaction stack, without forcing the rest of the app to
  care which provider is active.
- Good for:
  hand-tracking fallbacks, mixed controller or optical input, provider
  migration, and interoperability between existing XR interaction stacks.
- Why it matters:
  it lets a future tool reuse one `hand interaction contract` across multiple
  tracking backends.
- Strong references:
  `HandshakeVR`, `HandOfLesser`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  input-compatibility layers, shared hand abstractions, and future bridge tools
  that should tolerate multiple tracking sources.

## Method 80: Vendor-specific gaze IPC translated into an OpenXR API layer

- What it is:
  a vendor-specific eye-tracking source is exposed through local IPC and then
  adapted into standard OpenXR gaze extensions by an API layer that only
  activates when the relevant extensions are requested.
- Good for:
  vendor eye-tracking unlocks, custom gaze hardware, experimental gaze sources,
  and XR runtimes where the standard app contract should hide vendor-specific
  plumbing.
- Why it matters:
  it creates a reusable bridge from `custom gaze backend` to
  `standard OpenXR-facing surface`.
- Strong references:
  `PSVR2_OpenXR_Eye_Tracking`, `OpenXR-Eye-Trackers`,
  `etvr-openxr-layer`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  gaze-layer research, vendor enhancement paths, and future eye-tracking bridge
  experiments.

## Method 81: Runtime-side XR utility platform split across desktop host, landing-space app, and API layer

- What it is:
  a broader XR utility platform divides responsibilities between a desktop host,
  a runtime-adjacent app or landing space, and an API layer that adapts data or
  behavior at the runtime boundary.
- Good for:
  service-heavy XR utilities, runtime augmentation, companion spaces,
  transport-to-runtime adaptation, and platform-shaped diagnostic tools.
- Why it matters:
  it keeps orchestration, UX, and runtime adaptation from collapsing into one
  hard-to-maintain binary.
- Strong references:
  `clearxr-server`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  larger runtime-side tools that need both desktop control surfaces and
  runtime-level adaptation.

## Method 82: Plugin-manifest overlay platform with Electron control shell and native overlay interop

- What it is:
  a desktop application hosts overlays through native interop while a plugin
  system, manifest model, and persistence layer manage feature growth.
- Good for:
  monitor surfaces, dashboard suites, modular overlay platforms, domain-specific
  utility shells, and plugin-driven XR tooling.
- Why it matters:
  it turns a one-off overlay app into a reusable platform with install,
  update, and persistence semantics.
- Strong references:
  `vrkit-platform`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  future overlay platforms that may need extensibility beyond one utility.

## Method 83: IPC command surface that spawns synthetic controllers and trackers

- What it is:
  an OpenVR driver exposes a narrow command-oriented IPC contract so external
  processes can create controllers or trackers and update their pose or input
  state.
- Good for:
  controller emulation, external sensor bridges, custom input devices, rapid
  prototyping, and thin language bindings on top of a driver.
- Why it matters:
  it makes `external process -> synthetic SteamVR device` a reusable platform
  boundary instead of a one-off hardcoded bridge.
- Strong references:
  `Yet-Another-OpenVR-IPC-Driver`, `Simple-OpenVR-Bridge-Driver`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  driver bridges, custom-device experiments, and controller-emulation helpers.

## Method 84: Gesture-configurable hand-tracking bridge that emulates full controllers

- What it is:
  a hand-tracking tool maps gesture states into controller semantics through a
  lightweight gesture config and a dedicated SteamVR-facing input profile.
- Good for:
