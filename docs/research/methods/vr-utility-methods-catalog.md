# VR Utility Methods Catalog

- Date: `2026-04-18`
- Purpose: extract reusable implementation methods and product patterns from the
  tracked VR repositories, so `VR-apps-lab` can grow around proven approaches rather
  than only around named projects.

## How to use this file

Use this document when designing a new module or utility and ask:

1. which implementation method fits the problem?
2. which public repositories already demonstrate that method?
3. is the method better suited as:
   - overlay
   - API layer
   - background desktop utility
   - service/bridge
   - driver
   - creator tool

  the primary UI layer.
- Good for:
  rich dashboards, remote-control panels, streamer tools, HTML/CSS-based
  interfaces, plugin-friendly control surfaces.
- Why it matters:
  this can dramatically speed up UI iteration and lowers the cost of complex
  panel design.
- Strong references:
  `SteamVR-Webkit`, `overlay_experiments`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  advanced dashboards and external-control surfaces.

## Method 18: SteamVR environment helper and runtime hygiene tool

  dashboard input, compositor state, or overlay-heavy workflows.
- Good for:
  toggles, dashboard fixes, distortion tuning, headroom helpers, tray tools,
  pre-launch configuration.
- Why it matters:
  many valuable VR utilities are not overlays at all - they remove runtime
  friction around SteamVR.
- Strong references:
  `steamvr-exconfig`, `dashfix`, `SteamVR-Toggle`, `steamvr-undistort`,
  `SteamVR-VoidScene`, `OculusKiller`, `SteamVRNoHeadset`,

  an app whose real job is to keep one or more VR overlays alive while the
  desktop window stays hidden, minimized, or visually irrelevant.
- Good for:
  background overlay suites, tray-driven utilities, Unity-based dashboards
  without desktop clutter, status indicators that should feel always-on.
- Why it matters:
  many practical VR tools are valuable precisely because they do not behave
  like normal foreground desktop apps.
- Strong references:
  `HeadlessOverlayToolkit`, `SteaMeeter`, `VRCMicOverlay`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  always-on utility hosts and background helper surfaces.

## Method 20: Runtime inventory and capability matrix

- What it is:
  a structured catalog of runtime, middleware, or client capabilities that can
  be parsed, compared, and rendered into human-readable reports or diagnostics.
- Good for:
  capability dashboards, compatibility reports, runtime-health tools, extension
  support matrices, and environment triage.
- Why it matters:
  prose notes alone do not scale once the repository starts comparing many XR
  runtimes, layers, and clients.
- Strong references:
  `OpenXR-Inventory`, `xr-picker`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  capability intelligence behind `OpenXR Doctor` and related research tools.

## Method 21: Vendor shell replacement and runtime auto-redirect

- What it is:
  replace, intercept, or supervise a vendor launcher or dashboard process so it
  redirects into a different VR runtime or workflow.
- Good for:
  Oculus-to-SteamVR flows, startup cleanup, desktop runtime redirection, and
  narrow environment helpers.
- Why it matters:
  not every valuable VR tool lives inside the headset; some remove friction by
  fixing runtime launch behavior.
- Strong references:
  `OculusKiller`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  advanced environment-helper and compatibility research.

## Method 22: Headsetless and null-driver development workflow

- What it is:
  run SteamVR or OpenXR tooling without a real headset through null drivers,
  virtual HMDs, or simulator runtimes.
- Good for:

  full hardware, and reproducible dev setups.
- Why it matters:
  this method lowers the barrier to developing VR utilities and diagnostics.
- Strong references:
  `SteamVRNoHeadset`, `ViveTrackerExample`, `VirtualSteamVRDriver`,
  `OpenXR-Simulator`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  developer tooling, research harnesses, and workflow docs.

  acquire SteamVR/OpenVR mirror textures and route them into an external
  desktop application or capture pipeline.
- Good for:
  OBS plugins, creator tools, debugging, stream production, and research
  recording.
- Why it matters:
  capture bridges are a distinct class of VR utility that connects runtime
  output to non-VR tools.
- Strong references:
  `OBS-OpenVR-Input-Plugin`.
- Best fit for `VR-apps-lab`:
  creator workflows and runtime-inspection side tools.

## Method 24: Mixed tracking and controller bridge

- What it is:
  convert foreign runtime devices, external services, or non-native hardware
  into SteamVR/OpenVR controllers, trackers, sensors, or HMD-like devices.
- Good for:
  MixedVR setups, controller reuse, tracker bridging, external pose services,
  and hardware interoperability experiments.
- Why it matters:
  this is one of the richest paths for turning external ecosystems into usable
  VR devices.
