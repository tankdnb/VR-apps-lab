# Project Registry

- Date: `2026-04-19`
- Scope: canonical grouped registry of repositories currently tracked by
  `VR-apps-lab`
- Purpose: make every tracked project discoverable through one file, with a
  visible family and current study status.

## Status legend

- `Already studied`
- `Partially studied`
- `Not studied deeply`
- `Fork / variant only`

## How to use this file

- Use this as the canonical "what is in scope" registry.
- Use `../landscape/project-families.md` to understand family overlap.
- Use `../landscape/not-yet-studied-deeply.md` for priority next passes.
- Use `../program/study-method.md` and `../templates/project-study-template.md`
  when deepening an entry.

## Registry maintenance rule

Any future repository added to `VR-apps-lab` should update:

1. this file;
2. `../landscape/project-families.md` if the overlap model changes;
3. `../landscape/not-yet-studied-deeply.md` if a follow-up pass is needed.
