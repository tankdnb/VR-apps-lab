# Current Focus

- Date: `2026-04-21`
- Purpose: give a short `what matters now` view of `VR-apps-lab` without
  forcing a new session or visitor through the full wave archive.

## What this repository is doing now

`VR-apps-lab` is being maintained as a public:

- `knowledge repository`
- `pattern library`
- `working lab`

for VR utilities, overlays, diagnostics, tracking helpers, runtime tools, and
experimental XR integrations.

The repository is no longer trying to act like one hidden main application.

## Strongest active directions

These are the clearest current product and research lines:

1. `Overlay implementation references and overlay-first utility hosts`
   small and medium overlay surfaces remain one of the strongest donor areas in
   the whole repo, now including thinner access layers and starter variants.
2. `OpenXR runtime, capability-injection layers, diagnostics, and micro-layer utilities`
   the repository now has enough material to support both an `OpenXR doctor /
   runtime inspector` branch and smaller capability, passthrough, and
   operator-facing layer utilities.
3. `Tracker, OSC, and virtual-device tooling`
   `VMT`, OSC exporters, and synthetic-device hosts form a strong reusable
   implementation family.
4. `Mixed-VR bridge patterns`
   controller, hand-tracking, and hardware-interop bridges are now a clear
   comparison line of their own.
5. `OpenVR driver learning paths`
   the repo now contains a stronger baseline for future driver experiments than
   it did earlier.
6. `Accessibility, communication, and companion surfaces`
   small user-value-first tools remain an important public direction, not just
   a side branch.
7. `VR audio, immersive playback, projection-aware video systems, and creator-facing media tools`
   the repository now has a clearer branch for mic-state tools, media-player
   shells, panoramic video donors, nonstandard 3D viewers, spatial-audio
   substrate, and creator-side media frameworks.
8. `VRChat creator-world tooling, runtime infrastructure, and utility prefabs`
   the repository now has a much clearer branch for world-authoring helpers,
   creator runtime substrate, event-camera systems, and reusable world utility
   surfaces.

## Most useful current docs

Use these first if you need fast recovery:

1. `../foundation/current-operating-context.md`
2. `program/new-session-quickstart.md`
3. `catalog/project-registry.md`
4. `landscape/project-families.md`
5. `landscape/not-yet-studied-deeply.md`
6. `methods/vr-utility-methods-catalog.md`

## Highest-value next follow-up passes

If a new research wave should start soon, these remain especially strong next
directions:

1. `Overlay implementation references and overlay-first hosts`
2. `OpenXR capability-injection, passthrough extension, and runtime-side intervention tooling`
3. `Vision-based hand and body tracking bridges`
4. `Virtual display and repurposed output workflows`
5. `OpenVR capture, replay, and orchestration toolchains`
6. `Historical utility-suite recovery`
7. `Browser panoramic video players and projection-aware web playback`
8. `Creator-side synced video player frameworks and queue frontends`
9. `Engine-side stereo panoramic viewers and vendor playback samples`
10. `Transformed, volumetric, and nonstandard 3D video viewers`
11. `Microphone control, voice-input, and audio routing helpers`
12. `Immersive media playback and browser video shells`
13. `Spatial audio SDKs, renderers, and audio-object optimization`
14. `Creator-facing audio systems and world voice management`
15. `VRChat world-authoring toolkits and optimization helpers`
16. `VRChat world runtime infrastructure and per-player state helpers`
17. `VRChat camera, staging, and admin-control systems`
18. `VRChat interaction prefabs and utility UI`

## Current repository-maintenance priorities

Besides new research waves, the main repository-maintenance work now is:

- keep `project-registry.md` as the clear per-repository source of truth;
- keep `project-families.md` focused on synthesis instead of status ownership;
- keep `not-yet-studied-deeply.md` focused on active queueing;
- reduce archive pressure in front-door docs;
- preserve wave history without making every entry document chronological.

## If you need deeper history

For the full chronological archive, use:

- `program/README.md`
- `landscape/README.md`
- `landscape/vr-projects-master-index.md`
