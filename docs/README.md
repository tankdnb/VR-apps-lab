# Documentation Index

This folder contains both product-facing plans and technical research gathered
while exploring VR overlays, passthrough, OpenXR/OpenVR integration, and future
utility directions.

## Research synthesis

- `research/landscape/README.md`  
  Entry point for documents that group repositories by overlap families and
  track what still needs deeper study.

- `research/landscape/project-families.md`  
  Logical overlap map for the repository landscape: runtime tools, overlay
  suites, tracker bridges, Lighthouse managers, battery/device monitors,
  accessibility tools, driver learning paths, and vendor enhancement tooling.

- `research/landscape/not-yet-studied-deeply.md`  
  Prioritized backlog of repositories and families that are either missing from
  `VR.app` or still only lightly covered.

## Foundation docs

- `platform-foundation.md`  
  Repository charter, reusable capabilities, and design principles.

- `public-roadmap.md`  
  Recommended roadmap for turning this repository into a family of VR utility
  applications.

- `vr-utilities-repo-landscape.md`  
  Consolidated landscape of public VR utility repositories worth learning from.

- `vr-projects-master-index.md`  
  Combined index of already tracked projects plus an additional research wave of
  useful VR repositories.

- `vr-projects-wave-3-utilities.md`  
  Additional wave focused on OpenXR layer tools, runtime switchers, overlay
  services, accessibility utilities, lighthouse managers, and VR automation
  tooling.

- `vr-projects-wave-4-gap-fill.md`  
  Gap-fill wave that maps already covered projects from a later list and adds
  the still-missing ones such as `OpenXR-Switcher`, `OpenVR-Display-Devices`,
  `LighthouseManager`, and `OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator2`.

- `vr-projects-wave-5-osc-tracking-tools.md`  
  Niche utility wave focused on OSC bridges, tracked-device markers,
  marker-based tracking, Lighthouse setup helpers, and battery micro-tools.

- `vr-projects-wave-6-driver-bridges.md`  
  Driver-focused wave covering vendor enhancement tooling, virtual trackers,
  remote tracking, custom hardware bridges, and micro desktop helpers.

- `vr-projects-wave-7-depth-pass.md`  
  Follow-up depth pass on under-documented repositories, with stronger
  implementation notes for early overlay, helper, passthrough, metrics, and
  creator-tool projects.

## Original Reality Window docs

- `overlay-vr-mvp-spec.md`  
  Initial MVP spec for the camera-backed overlay window concept.

- `current-feasibility-status.md`  
  Current engineering status across desktop OpenVR and PICO/OpenXR paths.

- `pico-openxr-camera-path.md`  
  Findings from official PICO/OpenXR extension probing.

- `pico-connect-constraint.md`  
  Why `Pico Connect` coexistence became a hard product requirement.

- `pico-connect-passthrough-spike.md`  
  Notes for testing passthrough coexistence during active streaming.

## Reuse and research docs

- `external-repos-reuse-plan.md`
- `vrperfkit-reuse-plan.md`
- `alvr-reuse-plan.md`
- `openxr-steamvr-passthrough-reuse-plan.md`
- `openvr-advancedsettings-reuse-plan.md`

These files summarize what is reusable, what is only architectural inspiration,
and where the sharp edges are.
